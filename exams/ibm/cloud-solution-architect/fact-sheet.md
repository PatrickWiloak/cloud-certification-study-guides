**Good luck with your IBM Cloud Solution Architect certification exam!**

*Remember: Architecture is about making informed trade-offs. Focus on understanding the "why" behind architectural decisions, not just the "what." Consider multiple dimensions - functionality, performance, security, cost, and operational complexity - when evaluating solutions.*
