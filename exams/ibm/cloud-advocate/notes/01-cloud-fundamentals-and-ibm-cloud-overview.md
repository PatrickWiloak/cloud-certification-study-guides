## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **On-demand self-service**: Provision resources without human interaction
- **Broad network access**: Available over the network via standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling**: Multi-tenant model with dynamic assignment
- **Rapid elasticity**: Scale resources up or down quickly
- **Measured service**: Pay only for what you use

### Cloud Service Models

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
- You manage: Applications, data, runtime, middleware, OS
- Provider manages: Virtualization, servers, storage, networking
- **IBM Cloud Examples**: Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, VPC Infrastructure

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications
- You manage: Applications, data
- Provider manages: Runtime, middleware, OS, virtualization, servers, storage, networking
- **IBM Cloud Examples**: Cloud Foundry, Code Engine, Red Hat OpenShift

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Complete software solution on a pay-as-you-go basis
- Provider manages: Everything
- **IBM Cloud Examples**: Watson services, IBM Cloudant, IBM Cloud Pak solutions

### Cloud Deployment Models

#### Public Cloud
- Resources owned and operated by third-party cloud service provider
- Delivered over the internet
- Resources shared among multiple customers
- **Benefits**: Lower costs, no maintenance, high scalability

#### Private Cloud
- Computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization
- Can be physically located on-site or hosted by third-party
- **Benefits**: Greater control, enhanced security, compliance

#### Hybrid Cloud
- Combination of public and private clouds
- Data and applications shared between them
- **Benefits**: Flexibility, optimization of existing infrastructure, compliance

#### Multicloud
- Use of multiple cloud computing services from different vendors
- Can include any combination of public, private, or edge clouds
- **Benefits**: Avoid vendor lock-in, optimize for specific workloads

## IBM Cloud Architecture

### Global Infrastructure

IBM Cloud operates a global network of data centers providing low-latency, high-performance cloud services worldwide.

**Infrastructure Components:**
- **Regions**: Geographic areas containing multiple data centers
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Isolated locations within regions
- **Data Centers**: Physical facilities housing computing resources
- **Points of Presence (PoPs)**: Network edge locations

### Multi-Zone Regions (MZRs)

Multi-Zone Regions provide high availability by distributing resources across multiple data centers within a region.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimum of 3 availability zones per MZR
- Each zone is a separate physical data center
- Independent power, cooling, and networking
- Low-latency connectivity between zones (< 2ms)
- Synchronous replication possible within MZR

**Benefits:**
- Automatic failover capabilities
- Zero data loss for synchronous replication
- Protection against data center failures
- Maintain application availability during outages

### Network Architecture

**IBM Cloud Global Network:**
- Private network backbone connecting all regions
- Public internet connectivity at each location
- Direct Link for dedicated private connections
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) for edge caching

**Network Isolation:**
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation
- Security Groups for instance-level firewall
- Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) for subnet-level control
- Private endpoints for service connectivity

### Compute Architecture

**Virtual Servers:**
- Hypervisor-based virtualization (KVM)
- Multiple profiles (balanced, compute, memory, storage)
- Support for custom images
- Integration with VPC networking

**Bare Metal Servers:**
- Single-tenant physical servers
- No hypervisor overhead
- Hourly or monthly billing
- High-performance computing workloads

**Containers:**

- Example: `us-south-1`, `us-south-2`, `us-south-3`

**Best Practices:**
- Deploy across multiple zones for HA
- Use zone-aware services when available
- Implement load balancing across zones
- Consider data transfer costs between zones

### IBM Cloud Satellite

**Best Practices:**
- Group by project, environment, or team
- Use naming conventions
- Limit number of resource groups
- Cannot move resources between groups (most services)

**Creating Resource Groups:**
```bash
# Create a resource group
ibmcloud resource group-create my-resource-group

# List resource groups
ibmcloud resource groups

# Target a resource group
ibmcloud target -g my-resource-group
```

**Tagging Resources:**
```bash
# Attach tags to a resource
ibmcloud resource tag-attach \
  --resource-name my-instance \
  --tag-names env:prod,team:backend

# Search resources by tag
ibmcloud resource search 'tags:env:prod'
```

### Resource Reclamation

When you delete a resource, it enters a reclamation period:
- Default: 7 days
- Resource suspended but not deleted
- Can be restored during this period
- Automatically deleted after period expires

**Managing Reclamations:**
```bash
# List reclaimed resources
ibmcloud resource reclamations

# Restore a resource
ibmcloud resource reclamation-restore <reclamation-id>

# Delete immediately
ibmcloud resource reclamation-delete <reclamation-id>
```
