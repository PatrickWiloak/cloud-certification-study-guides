# Cloud Concepts - AZ-900

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

### Key Characteristics
- **On-demand self-service:** Users can provision computing capabilities automatically
- **Broad network access:** Services available over the network via standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling:** Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers
- **Rapid elasticity:** Capabilities can be rapidly scaled out and in
- **Measured service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use

## Cloud Computing Benefits

### High Availability
- **Definition:** The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible when needed
- **Azure Implementation:** Multiple data centers, redundancy, failover capabilities
- **SLA:** Service Level Agreements guarantee uptime percentages (99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%)

### Scalability
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up):** Add more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Add more machines to the pool of resources
- **Azure Auto-scaling:** Automatically adjust resources based on demand

### Elasticity
- **Definition:** Ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand
- **Real-time adjustment:** Resources adjust dynamically to workload changes
- **Cost optimization:** Pay only for what you use

### Agility
- **Rapid deployment:** Deploy and configure resources quickly
- **Fast experimentation:** Test new ideas with minimal upfront investment
- **Global reach:** Deploy applications closer to users worldwide

### Fault Tolerance
- **Redundancy:** Multiple copies of data and applications
- **Automatic failover:** Seamless switching to backup systems
- **Recovery capabilities:** Automatic recovery from hardware failures

### Disaster Recovery
- **Backup and restore:** Regular backups to prevent data loss
- **Geographical distribution:** Data replicated across multiple regions
- **Business continuity:** Maintain operations during disasters

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- **Definition:** Upfront spending on physical infrastructure
- **Characteristics:**
  - Large initial investment
  - Assets depreciate over time
  - Requires forecasting future needs
  - Fixed costs regardless of usage
- **Examples:** Servers, networking equipment, data center facilities

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- **Definition:** Ongoing spending on services and products
- **Characteristics:**
  - Pay-as-you-go model
  - No upfront costs
  - Immediate tax deduction
  - Flexible spending based on usage
- **Examples:** Cloud subscriptions, software licenses, utilities

### Cloud Computing Financial Model
- **Consumption-based:** Pay only for resources used
- **No upfront costs:** Eliminate large capital investments
- **Predictable costs:** Better budget planning and cost control
- **Economies of scale:** Benefit from cloud provider's purchasing power

## Cloud Service Types

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- **Definition:** Rent IT infrastructure (servers, VMs, storage, networks) on a pay-as-you-go basis
- **Characteristics:**
  - Most flexible cloud service
  - Control over operating systems, middleware, runtime
  - Similar to renting a data center
- **Use Cases:**
  - Migrate existing applications to cloud
  - Development and testing environments
  - Backup and disaster recovery
- **Azure Examples:** Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, Azure Networking

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- **Definition:** Complete development and deployment environment in the cloud
- **Characteristics:**
  - Includes infrastructure plus operating system, middleware, development tools
  - Focus on application development, not infrastructure management
  - Built-in scalability and high availability
- **Use Cases:**
  - Application development and deployment
  - Analytics and business intelligence
  - Database management
- **Azure Examples:** Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- **Definition:** Complete applications delivered over the internet
- **Characteristics:**
  - Ready-to-use applications
  - No installation or maintenance required
  - Accessible from anywhere with internet
- **Use Cases:**
  - Email and messaging
  - Business productivity applications
  - Customer relationship management
- **Azure Examples:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Exchange Online

### Shared Responsibility Model

| Service Type | Customer Responsibilities | Microsoft Responsibilities |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **On-premises** | Data, endpoints, accounts, access management, applications, network controls, operating system, physical hosts, physical network, physical datacenter | None |
| **IaaS** | Data, endpoints, accounts, access management, applications, network controls, operating system | Physical hosts, physical network, physical datacenter |
| **PaaS** | Data, endpoints, accounts, access management, applications | Network controls, operating system, physical hosts, physical network, physical datacenter |
| **SaaS** | Data, endpoints, accounts, access management | Applications, network controls, operating system, physical hosts, physical network, physical datacenter |

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud
- **Definition:** Services offered over the internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them
- **Characteristics:**
  - Owned and operated by third-party cloud service provider
  - Hardware, software, and infrastructure shared among customers
  - No capital expenditures for scaling up
- **Benefits:**
  - Lower costs (no need to purchase hardware or software)
  - No maintenance (maintained by service provider)
  - Near-unlimited scalability
  - High reliability
- **Considerations:**
  - Less control over resources and security
  - Data stored in provider's data centers

### Private Cloud
- **Definition:** Computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization
- **Characteristics:**
  - Can be physically located at organization's on-site datacenter
  - Can be hosted by a third-party service provider
  - Hardware and services not shared with other organizations
- **Benefits:**
  - More control over resources and security
  - Compliance with strict regulatory requirements
  - Customization options
- **Considerations:**
  - Higher costs (hardware, software, maintenance)
  - Limited scalability
  - Requires IT expertise

### Hybrid Cloud
- **Definition:** Combination of public and private clouds connected by technology
- **Characteristics:**
  - Allows data and applications to move between environments
  - Provides flexibility in deployment options
  - Leverages benefits of both public and private clouds
- **Benefits:**
  - Flexibility (choose where to run applications)
  - Cost optimization (use public cloud for non-sensitive workloads)
  - Compliance (keep sensitive data in private cloud)
- **Use Cases:**
  - Burst to cloud during peak demand
  - Gradual cloud migration
  - Backup and disaster recovery

### Multi-cloud
- **Definition:** Use of multiple cloud computing and storage services from different vendors
