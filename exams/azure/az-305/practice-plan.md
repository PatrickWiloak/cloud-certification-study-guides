## Critical Architecture Skills

### Design Thinking
- Understand business requirements
- Balance cost vs performance
- Consider security from start
- Plan for scalability
- Design for resilience

### Azure Well-Architected Framework
- Cost optimization
- Operational excellence
- Performance efficiency
- Reliability
- Security

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Hub-and-spoke networking
- Multi-tier applications
- CQRS and Event Sourcing

## Case Study Approach

### For Each Scenario:
1. Identify requirements (functional and non-functional)
2. Consider constraints (budget, timeline, compliance)
3. Evaluate options (pros/cons of each service)
4. Design solution (architecture diagram)
5. Justify decisions (why this approach)

## Exam Tips

- Focus on "why" not "how"
- Know service limitations and quotas
- Understand cost implications
- Consider hybrid scenarios
- Think about security first
- Know when to use which service
- Practice architecture diagrams
