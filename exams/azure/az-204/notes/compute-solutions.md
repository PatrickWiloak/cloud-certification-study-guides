### Supporting Services
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Azure CLI and PowerShell
- Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions
- Application Insights

## Best Practices

### VM and Container Management
- Use managed disks for reliability
- Implement proper tagging strategy for resources
- Leverage Azure Container Registry for private container storage
- Use staging slots for web app deployments

### App Service Configuration
- Store connection strings and secrets in Key Vault
- Enable Always On for production apps
- Configure health checks for reliability
- Implement deployment slots for zero-downtime deployments

### Azure Functions Development
- Choose appropriate hosting plan (Consumption, Premium, Dedicated)
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use durable functions for stateful workflows
- Monitor function execution and performance

## Common Scenarios

### Deployment Scenarios
- Blue-green deployments using App Service slots
- Containerized application deployment to ACI or AKS
- Serverless event-driven processing with Functions
- Microservices architecture using containers

### Scaling Scenarios
- Horizontal scaling with App Service autoscale rules
- Function app scaling based on queue depth
- Container orchestration with AKS
- Performance optimization for high-traffic applications

## Study Tips

- Practice deploying applications using multiple methods (Portal, CLI, ARM templates)
- Understand the differences between hosting plans and when to use each
- Hands-on experience with ARM template creation and validation is crucial
- Learn function bindings and triggers thoroughly
- Practice implementing autoscaling rules with different metrics
- Understand container image workflows from build to deployment
