# Implement Azure Security

## Overview
This domain covers implementing user authentication and authorization using Microsoft Identity Platform, and securing cloud solutions with Azure Key Vault and managed identities. It represents 20-25% of the exam and focuses on identity management and secrets protection.

## Services Reference

### Core Services
- Microsoft Identity Platform
- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure App Configuration
- Microsoft Graph API

### Supporting Services
- Azure Managed Identity (System-assigned, User-assigned)
- Azure RBAC
- Azure AD B2C for customer identity
- Azure AD B2B for partner access

**[ðŸ“– Azure Role-Based Access Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/)** - RBAC and permission management
**[ðŸ“– Azure AD B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/)** - Customer identity and access management

## Best Practices

### Identity and Access Management
- Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Implement least privilege principle with RBAC
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use conditional access policies for risk-based access
- Implement proper token validation in applications

### Secrets Management
- Never store secrets in code or configuration files
- Use Key Vault for all secrets, keys, and certificates
- Implement managed identities to eliminate credentials in code
- Rotate secrets and keys regularly
- Enable soft delete and purge protection for Key Vault

### API Security
- Validate access tokens on every API call
- Use app roles for application-level authorization
- Implement API scopes for granular permissions
- Log authentication and authorization events

## Common Scenarios

### Authentication Flows
- Single-page application (SPA) authentication with MSAL.js
- Web application sign-in with OpenID Connect
- Service-to-service authentication with client credentials
- Mobile app authentication with MSAL libraries

### Secrets and Configuration Management
- Application retrieving database connection strings from Key Vault
- Certificate-based authentication for apps
- Managed identity accessing Key Vault without credentials
- Configuration updates without application redeployment

### Authorization Patterns
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Claims-based authorization in applications
- API permission consent flow
- Microsoft Graph API calls for user data
