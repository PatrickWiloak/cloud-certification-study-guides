## Best Practices

### Caching Strategies
- Implement cache-aside pattern for data caching
- Use appropriate cache expiration policies
- Consider cache warming for frequently accessed data
- Monitor cache hit ratios and optimize accordingly
- Use Redis clustering for large-scale applications

### Content Delivery
- Configure CDN caching rules based on content type
- Use custom domains with CDN endpoints
- Implement query string caching when appropriate
- Leverage CDN compression for better performance
- Configure geo-filtering for content restrictions

### Application Monitoring
- Instrument all critical application paths
- Use correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Set up proactive alerts for anomalies
- Monitor application dependencies
- Track custom metrics for business KPIs

### Performance Optimization
- Identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize database queries
- Minimize network round trips

## Common Scenarios

### Caching Use Cases
- Session state management with Redis
- API response caching for improved performance
- Database query result caching
- Rate limiting implementation with Redis
- Distributed locking in multi-instance scenarios

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting
- Application performance degradation investigation
- Exception tracking and analysis
- User behavior analysis with Application Insights
- Dependency failure detection and alerting
- Performance baseline establishment and monitoring

### Optimization Scenarios
- Static content acceleration with CDN
- Application scaling based on metrics
- Response time optimization with caching
- Bandwidth cost reduction with CDN
- Multi-region content delivery
