## Best Practices

### Cosmos DB Development
- Choose appropriate consistency level based on requirements
- Design effective partition keys to avoid hot partitions
- Use point reads when possible for best performance
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Monitor RU consumption and optimize queries

### Blob Storage Management
- Use appropriate storage tier (Hot, Cool, Archive)
- Implement lifecycle management policies for cost optimization
- Use SAS tokens for secure, time-limited access
- Enable soft delete for data protection
- Leverage blob indexing for efficient searching

### Performance Optimization
- Use async operations for better throughput
- Batch operations when possible
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Choose appropriate consistency level for Cosmos DB

## Common Scenarios

### Data Storage Patterns
- Document storage with Cosmos DB SQL API
- Time-series data with appropriate partition keys
- Large file storage and retrieval with Blob Storage
- Hierarchical data storage with Data Lake Storage Gen2

### Integration Scenarios
- Change feed processing for real-time updates
- Blob trigger functions for automated processing
- Data replication across regions for disaster recovery
- CDN integration for static content delivery

## Study Tips
