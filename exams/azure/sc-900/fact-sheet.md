## Key Concepts Summary

### Zero Trust Principles
1. **Verify explicitly** - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
2. **Use least privilege access** - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access
3. **Assume breach** - Minimize blast radius and segment access, verify end-to-end encryption

### Defense in Depth Layers
1. **Physical security** - Datacenter access controls
2. **Identity & access** - Authentication, SSO, MFA
3. **Perimeter** - DDoS protection, firewalls
4. **Network** - Segmentation, access controls, deny by default
5. **Compute** - Secure VM access, endpoint protection, patching
6. **Application** - Secure development, no credentials in code
7. **Data** - Encryption at rest and in transit, classification

### Identity Types in Entra ID
- **User identities** - Employees and internal users
- **Workload identities** - Applications and services (service principals, managed identities)
- **Device identities** - Registered, joined, and hybrid-joined devices
- **External identities** - Guest users and B2B collaboration partners

### Microsoft Defender Suite
- **Defender for Endpoint** - Device/endpoint protection
- **Defender for Office 365** - Email and collaboration security
- **Defender for Identity** - On-premises AD threat detection
- **Defender for Cloud Apps** - CASB for SaaS applications
- **Defender for Cloud** - CSPM and CWPP for Azure and multi-cloud
- **Microsoft 365 Defender** - XDR coordinating all Defender products
- **Microsoft Sentinel** - SIEM and SOAR platform

### Compliance Solution Categories
- **Information Protection** - Classification, labeling, encryption
- **Data Lifecycle Management** - Retention, deletion, records management
- **Insider Risk Management** - Detecting malicious or negligent insider actions
- **eDiscovery and Audit** - Legal holds, content search, activity logging
- **Compliance Management** - Assessments, scores, improvement actions

## Exam Tips

1. **Understand concepts over memorization** - Focus on when and why to use each service rather than memorizing every feature
2. **Know the differences** - Be clear on distinctions between similar services (e.g., Defender for Cloud vs. Defender for Endpoint)
3. **Licensing awareness** - Understand which features require Premium licenses (especially for Entra ID P1/P2)
4. **Scenario-based thinking** - Practice identifying appropriate solutions for given business requirements
5. **Hands-on experience** - Use Microsoft Learn sandboxes and free trials to explore the services
6. **Service relationships** - Understand how services integrate (e.g., Intune + Conditional Access, Sentinel + Defender)
7. **Compliance frameworks** - Familiarize yourself with common regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001)
8. **Zero Trust mindset** - Many questions relate to implementing Zero Trust principles
