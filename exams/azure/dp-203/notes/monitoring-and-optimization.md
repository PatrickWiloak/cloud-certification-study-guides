## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy
- Implement comprehensive logging at all pipeline stages
- Set up proactive alerts for failures and performance degradation
- Use custom metrics for business-specific KPIs
- Create monitoring dashboards for key metrics
- Retain logs according to compliance requirements
- Monitor costs alongside performance metrics

### Performance Optimization
- Identify and eliminate bottlenecks systematically
- Use explain plans to understand query execution
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize file sizes (avoid small file problem)
- Use appropriate partitioning strategies
- Minimize data shuffling in Spark jobs

### Resource Management
- Right-size clusters based on workload
- Use auto-scaling for variable workloads
- Schedule non-critical jobs during off-peak hours
- Implement cost allocation tags
- Monitor resource utilization and adjust accordingly
- Use spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads

### Troubleshooting Approach
- Check pipeline activity run details and error messages
- Review metrics for anomalies
- Examine Spark UI for job details and stages
- Analyze query execution plans
- Check for data skew in partitions
- Review resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)

## Common Scenarios

### Performance Issues
- Slow-running queries in Synapse SQL pool
- Spark job failures due to out-of-memory errors
- Pipeline execution delays and timeouts
- Data skew causing uneven partition processing
- Small file problems affecting query performance

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Pipeline failure notifications
- Long-running query alerts
- Resource utilization threshold alerts
- Data quality validation failures
- Cost anomaly detection

### Optimization Tasks
- Query performance tuning with statistics and indexes
- Spark job optimization with repartitioning
- File compaction to reduce small files
- Distribution key selection for Synapse tables
- Materialized view creation for common queries

### Troubleshooting Workflows
