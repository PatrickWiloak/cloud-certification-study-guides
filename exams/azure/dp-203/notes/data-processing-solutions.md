## Best Practices

### Data Transformation
- Use Spark for large-scale transformations
- Use T-SQL for set-based operations in SQL pools
- Implement data quality checks at each stage
- Use schema validation before processing
- Handle null values consistently

### Batch Processing
- Implement idempotent pipelines
- Use incremental loads to minimize processing
- Partition data for parallel processing
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Monitor pipeline execution and performance
- Use metadata-driven pipelines for scalability

### Stream Processing
- Design for exactly-once or at-least-once semantics
- Use windowing functions for time-based aggregations
- Implement checkpointing for fault tolerance
- Handle late-arriving data appropriately
- Monitor streaming lag and throughput

### Pipeline Development
- Use parameters for configuration flexibility
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Version control all pipeline definitions
- Create reusable components and templates
- Implement CI/CD for pipeline deployment
- Test pipelines in non-production environments

## Common Scenarios

### Batch ETL Patterns
- Full load followed by incremental updates
- Change data capture (CDC) implementation
- SCD Type 2 updates in dimensions
- Fact table incremental loads
- Data quality validation and cleansing

### Stream Processing Use Cases
- Real-time dashboard updates
- IoT telemetry processing
- Fraud detection systems
- Log analytics and monitoring
- Real-time recommendation engines

### Data Integration
- Multi-source data consolidation
- Cloud-to-cloud data migration
- On-premises to cloud data replication
- API-based data ingestion
- File-based data processing

### Pipeline Orchestration
- Complex workflow dependencies
- Parallel execution for performance
- Conditional execution based on data
- Scheduled and event-driven pipelines
- Cross-service orchestration
