# Capabilities of Power Apps

## Overview
This domain covers Power Apps types, building applications, and integration capabilities. It represents 25-30% of the exam and focuses on understanding how to create custom business applications with low-code/no-code development.

## Key Topics

### Power Apps Types
- Canvas apps (pixel-perfect, flexible design)
- Model-driven apps (data-centric, form-based)
- Power Apps portals (external-facing websites)
- Differences and appropriate use cases for each type

### Building Power Apps
- Creating canvas apps from templates
- Creating canvas apps from data sources
- Creating canvas apps from blank
- Creating model-driven apps from Dataverse
- Sharing and publishing applications
- App versioning and updates

### Power Apps Integration
- Connecting to data sources (Dataverse, SharePoint, SQL, etc.)
- Using Power Apps with other Power Platform components
- Common connectors (Office 365, SharePoint, OneDrive)
- Custom connectors for proprietary systems
- Power Apps in Microsoft Teams
- Offline capabilities for mobile apps

## Services Reference

### Core Components
- Power Apps Studio (canvas app designer)
- Model-driven app designer
- Power Apps Mobile (iOS and Android)
- Power Apps portals
- Dataverse (underlying data platform)

### Data Sources and Connectors
- Microsoft Dataverse
- SharePoint
- SQL Server and Azure SQL
- Excel and OneDrive
- Dynamics 365

- Custom connectors

## Best Practices

### Canvas App Design
- Design for the target device (phone, tablet, desktop)

- Use collections for performance
- Cache data when appropriate
- Implement proper authentication

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize data calls in app startup
- Use delegation for large datasets
- Optimize gallery and collection usage
- Reduce number of controls on screens
- Use concurrent function for parallel calls
- Monitor app performance and errors
