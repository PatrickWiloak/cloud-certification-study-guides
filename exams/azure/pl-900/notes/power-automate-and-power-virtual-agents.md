# Capabilities of Power Automate and Power Virtual Agents

## Overview
This domain covers Power Automate flow types, automation capabilities, Power Virtual Agents chatbot creation, and integration scenarios. Together these topics represent 20-30% of the exam and focus on process automation and conversational AI.

## Key Topics

### Power Automate Types
- Cloud flows: Automated (event-triggered)
- Cloud flows: Instant (manually triggered)
- Cloud flows: Scheduled (time-based)
- Desktop flows (Robotic Process Automation - RPA)
- Business process flows (guided processes)

### Building Flows
- Creating flows from templates
- Using triggers (When, How, What)
- Using actions (Create, Update, Send, etc.)
- Flow control (conditions, loops, parallel branches)
- Flow sharing and management
- Error handling and retry logic

### Power Automate Integration
- Integration with Power Apps and Power BI
- Approval workflows
- Document generation and processing
- Email and notification automation
- Data synchronization between systems

### Power Virtual Agents Capabilities
- Creating chatbots without code
- Publishing bots to multiple channels (Teams, website, Facebook)
- Bot analytics and performance monitoring
- AI-powered natural language understanding

### Building Chatbots
- Topics and trigger phrases configuration
- Conversation flow design with nodes
- Using entities for information extraction
- Variables for maintaining context
- Integration with Power Automate flows
- Integration with other Power Platform components

## Services Reference

## Best Practices

### Flow Design
- Use meaningful names for flows and actions
- Implement error handling with scope and try-catch
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use variables to make flows maintainable
- Test flows thoroughly before deployment
- Monitor flow run history regularly

### Approval Workflows
- Clearly define approval criteria
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Include relevant information in approval requests
- Implement escalation paths
- Send notifications for status changes
- Track approval history

### RPA Best Practices
- Start with simple, repetitive tasks
- Document manual process steps first
- Use UI selectors carefully
- Implement error recovery
- Use attended vs unattended appropriately
- Monitor desktop flow execution

### Chatbot Design
- Start with FAQ topics from existing documentation
- Use clear, conversational language
- Implement fallback topics for unknown questions
- Test with real user questions
- Monitor conversation analytics
- Iterate based on user feedback

## Common Scenarios

### Power Automate Use Cases
- Approval workflow for expense reports
