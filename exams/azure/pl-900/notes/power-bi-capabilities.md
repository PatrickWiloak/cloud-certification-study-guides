- Building blocks: datasets, reports, dashboards, workspaces
- Power BI Report Server (on-premises)

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Connecting to various data sources
- Data transformation with Power Query
- Creating and sharing reports and dashboards
- Building visualizations (charts, tables, maps)
- Natural language queries (Q&A feature)
- Quick Insights for automatic pattern discovery

### Power BI Service Features
- Workspace creation and collaboration
- Apps for packaged content distribution
- Content packs for template solutions
- Row-level security (RLS) implementation
