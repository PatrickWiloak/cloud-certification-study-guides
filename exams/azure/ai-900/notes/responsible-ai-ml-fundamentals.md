## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts

- Input variables used for prediction
- Can be numerical, categorical, or text
- Also called attributes or predictors
- Example: In house price prediction - bedrooms, location, size

#### Labels
- Target variable to predict
- Known values in training data
- Unknown in new data
- Example: House price, customer churn, spam/not spam

#### Training
- Process of learning from data
- Algorithm adjusts to minimize errors
- Requires labeled data (supervised) or patterns (unsupervised)
- Produces a trained model

#### Model
- Mathematical representation of patterns learned
- Takes features as input
- Produces predictions as output
- Can be saved and deployed

#### Inference
- Using trained model to make predictions
- Also called scoring or prediction
- Processes new, unseen data
- Returns predicted labels or values

### Data Concepts

#### Datasets
1. **Training Data** (70-80%)
   - Used to train the model
   - Largest portion of data
   - Contains features and labels

2. **Validation Data** (10-15%)
   - Tune model parameters
   - Prevent overfitting
   - Select best model

3. **Test Data** (10-15%)

## Model Evaluation and Metrics

### Classification Metrics

#### Confusion Matrix

|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

#### Key Metrics

**Accuracy**
- Formula: (TP + TN) / Total
- Percentage of correct predictions
- Can be misleading with imbalanced data

**Precision**
- Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
- Of predicted positives, how many were correct
- Important when false positives are costly

**Recall (Sensitivity)**
- Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
- Of actual positives, how many were found
- Important when false negatives are costly

**F1 Score**
- Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balances both metrics

#### Example Scenarios

**Medical Diagnosis (High Recall Priority):**
- Missing cancer is worse than false alarm
- Optimize for recall
- Accept more false positives

**Spam Detection (High Precision Priority):**
- Missing important email is worse than seeing spam
- Optimize for precision
- Accept more false negatives

### Regression Metrics

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- Average absolute difference
- Easy to interpret
- Same units as target variable

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Average squared difference
- Penalizes large errors
- Not in original units

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- Square root of MSE
- Same units as target variable
- More sensitive to outliers

**R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
- Proportion of variance explained
- Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- Indicates model fit quality

### Overfitting and Underfitting

#### Overfitting
**Problem:** Model memorizes training data but fails on new data.

**Symptoms:**
- High training accuracy
- Low test accuracy
- Large gap between training and test performance

**Solutions:**
- More training data
- Simplify model
