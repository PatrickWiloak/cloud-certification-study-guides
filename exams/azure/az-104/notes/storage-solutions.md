- **Premium**: SSD-backed, low latency, high throughput

### Replication Options

**[ðŸ“– Azure Storage Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy)** - Choose the right replication strategy for your data

**Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)**:
- 3 copies within single datacenter
- 11 nines durability
- Lowest cost
- Protects against hardware failures
- Use Case: Non-critical, easily reproducible data

**Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)**:
- 3 copies across 3 availability zones

- Use Case: Critical applications requiring read access

### Access Tiers (Blob Storage)

**[ðŸ“– Blob Storage Access Tiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview)** - Optimize costs with hot, cool, and archive tiers

**Hot**:
- Frequently accessed data
- Highest storage cost, lowest access cost
- Default tier
- Optimized for active data

**Cool**:
- Infrequently accessed data (30+ days)
- Lower storage cost, higher access cost
- Minimum 30-day retention
- Use Case: Short-term backup, disaster recovery

**Archive**:
- Rarely accessed data (180+ days)
- Lowest storage cost, highest access/rehydration cost
- Minimum 180-day retention
- Offline tier, requires rehydration
- Rehydration: Standard (up to 15 hours), High priority (<1 hour)
- Use Case: Long-term backup, compliance archives

### Lifecycle Management
- Automatically transition blobs between tiers
- Delete old blobs or versions
- Rule-based policies
- Actions: Tier to cool, archive, delete

**Example Policy**:
- 0-30 days: Hot
- 30-90 days: Cool
