## Common Keywords

**Management & Governance**:
- "Prevent accidental deletion": Resource lock (CanNotDelete)
- "Enforce compliance": Azure Policy
- "Cost allocation": Tags
- "Multi-subscription management": Management groups

**Compute**:
- "High availability within datacenter": Availability Set
- "High availability across datacenters": Availability Zones
- "Auto-scale web app": VM Scale Sets or App Service
- "Zero downtime deployment": Deployment slots

**Storage**:
- "Share files between VMs": Azure Files (SMB)
- "Lowest cost long-term": Archive tier
- "Disaster recovery across regions": GRS or RA-GRS
- "Private access from VNet": Private endpoint

**Networking**:
- "Connect on-premises to Azure": VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute
- "Secure RDP/SSH without public IP": Azure Bastion
- "Layer 7 load balancing": Application Gateway
- "Global load balancing": Traffic Manager or Front Door

**Security**:
- "Least privilege": RBAC with minimum permissions
- "Delegate limited access": SAS token
- "Encrypt data at rest": Enable encryption (default for most)
- "Private connectivity to PaaS": Private endpoint

## Service Selection Patterns

### High Availability
- Availability Set: 99.95% SLA, within datacenter
- Availability Zone: 99.99% SLA, across datacenters
- Both: Best protection

### Load Balancing
- Azure Load Balancer: Layer 4, internal/public
- Application Gateway: Layer 7, WAF, SSL termination
- Front Door: Global, CDN, multi-region
- Traffic Manager: DNS-based, global

### Backup & DR
- Azure Backup: VM, Files, SQL backups
- Site Recovery: Disaster recovery, replication
- Geo-replication: Storage account level

### Monitoring
- Azure Monitor: Metrics and logs
- Application Insights: APM
- Log Analytics: Centralized logs
- Network Watcher: Network diagnostics

## PowerShell vs CLI

**When to Use**:
- Both achieve same results
- Know basic syntax for both
- Examples often show either/or

**Common Commands**:
```powershell
# PowerShell
Get-AzVM
New-AzVM
Set-AzVM
Remove-AzVM

# CLI
az vm list
az vm create
az vm update
az vm delete
```

## Hands-On Skills Required

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not reading full question**: Look for "NOT" or "EXCEPT"
2. **Ignoring constraints**: Cost, region, performance
3. **Over-complicating**: Start with simplest solution
4. **Missing keywords**: "Most", "least", "minimum"
5. **Confusing services**: Load Balancer vs App Gateway, Peering vs VPN
