# DevOps Source Control and Collaboration

## Overview
Effective source control and collaboration are fundamental to DevOps practices. This covers Git workflows, branching strategies, repository management, and team collaboration using Azure Repos and GitHub.

## Source Control Strategy

### Version Control Systems

#### Git Fundamentals
- **Distributed version control system**
- **Local repository:** Full history on each machine
- **Remote repository:** Centralized collaboration (Azure Repos, GitHub)
- **Key concepts:**
  - Commits: Snapshots of code
  - Branches: Parallel development lines
  - Merges: Combining branches
  - Pull requests: Code review and collaboration

#### Git vs Centralized VCS
| Feature | Git (Distributed) | TFVC (Centralized) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Repository | Full copy locally | Partial working copy |
| Offline work | Yes | Limited |
| Branching | Lightweight, fast | Heavier |
| Merging | Powerful, automated | More manual |
| Performance | Fast | Depends on server |

### Authentication Strategies

#### Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- **Use case:** Automated scripts, CI/CD, Git operations
- **Benefits:**
  - Scoped permissions
  - Revocable
  - Expiration dates
- **Security:** Store in Key Vault, never commit to code

#### SSH Keys
- **Use case:** Git operations without passwords
- **Setup:**
  ```bash
  # Generate SSH key
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
  
  # Add to ssh-agent
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
  # Add public key to Azure DevOps/GitHub
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

#### OAuth/Azure AD Integration
- **Use case:** Web applications, automated services
- **Benefits:**
  - No password storage
  - Token-based authentication
  - Azure AD integration
  - Conditional Access support

### Managing Large Files

#### Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- **Purpose:** Handle large binary files efficiently
- **How it works:**
  - Stores pointer in Git
  - Actual file in LFS storage
  - Downloads on checkout

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.mp4"

# Commit .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track large files with LFS"
```

#### Repository Size Management
- **Strategies:**
  - Use .gitignore for build artifacts
  - Avoid committing binaries
  - Use package management for dependencies
  - Clean up history if needed (carefully)
  - Archive old branches

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow

#### Overview
- **Best for:** Release-based software development
- **Branches:**
  - **main/master:** Production-ready code
  - **develop:** Integration branch
  - **feature/*:** New features
  - **release/*:** Release preparation
  - **hotfix/*:** Emergency production fixes

#### Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication develop

# Work on feature, commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop

# Merge release to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
```

#### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Good for versioned releases
- Supports parallel development

**Cons:**
- Complex for continuous deployment
- More branches to manage
- Merge overhead

### GitHub Flow

#### Overview
- **Best for:** Continuous deployment
- **Simpler than Git Flow**
- **Branches:**
  - **main:** Always deployable
  - **feature branches:** All work done here

#### Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b add-payment-gateway main

# Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement payment gateway"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin add-payment-gateway

# After PR review and approval, merge to main
# Deploy from main (automated)
```

#### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Simple and straightforward
- Perfect for CD
- Fewer branches to manage

**Cons:**
- Less suitable for versioned releases
- Main must always be deployable

### Trunk-Based Development

#### Overview
- **Philosophy:** Everyone commits to trunk (main) frequently
- **Short-lived branches:** Hours to 1-2 days max
- **Feature flags:** Control feature rollout

#### Implementation
```bash
# Work directly on main or very short-lived branches
git checkout main
git pull

# Make small changes
git add .
git commit -m "Small incremental change"
git push

# Or short-lived branch
git checkout -b quick-fix main
# Work (< 1 day)
git push
# Create PR, merge same day
```

#### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Faster integration
- Encourages small commits
- Good for CI/CD

**Cons:**
- Requires discipline
- Needs feature flags
- Requires good testing

### Release Flow (Microsoft)

#### Overview
- **Used by:** Microsoft for Azure DevOps
- **Combines:** Trunk-based + release branches

#### Branches
- **main:** Development happens here
- **release/*:** Created for releases
- **topic branches:** Short-lived feature branches

## Pull Request Guidelines

    exit 1
fi
```

#### Server-Side Hooks (Azure DevOps)
- **Pre-receive:** Validate before accepting push
- **Post-receive:** Trigger builds, notifications
- **Update:** Validate individual branch updates

### Workflow Hooks

#### Azure DevOps Service Hooks
```json
{
  "publisherId": "tfs",
  "eventType": "git.push",
  "resourceVersion": "1.0",
  "consumerId": "webHooks",
  "consumerActionId": "httpRequest",
  "publisherInputs": {
    "repository": "MyRepo",
    "branch": "refs/heads/main"
  },
  "consumerInputs": {
    "url": "https://myservice.com/webhook"
  }
}
```

**Common use cases:**
- Trigger external CI/CD
- Send notifications (Slack, Teams)
