## Key Topics

### Azure OpenAI Service Content Generation
- Azure OpenAI Service resource provisioning
- Azure OpenAI model selection and deployment
- Prompt submission for natural language generation
- Prompt submission for code generation
- DALL-E model usage for image generation
- Azure OpenAI APIs and SDKs implementation
- Chat completion API usage
- Streaming responses handling

### Optimize Generative AI
- Parameter configuration to control generation behavior
- Prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- Using your own data with Azure OpenAI (RAG pattern)
- Fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models
- Token management and optimization
- Content filtering and safety
- Cost optimization strategies

## Services Reference

### Core Services
- Azure OpenAI Service
- GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models
- DALL-E for image generation
- Embeddings models
- Azure Cognitive Search (for RAG)

### Supporting Services
- Azure Cognitive Search (for grounding)
- Azure AI Content Safety
- Azure Monitor (for monitoring)
- Azure Key Vault (for key management)
- Azure Storage (for training data)

## Best Practices

### Model Selection
- Use GPT-3.5-Turbo for cost-effective scenarios
- Use GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks
- Choose appropriate token limits for use case
- Consider latency requirements
- Balance cost vs capability needs
- Test multiple models for your scenario

### Prompt Engineering
- Provide clear instructions and context
- Use system messages to set behavior
- Include examples (few-shot learning)
- Be specific about output format
- Iterate and refine prompts based on results
- Use delimiters to separate sections
- Ask model to think step-by-step for complex tasks

### Response Configuration
- Set temperature for creativity vs consistency trade-off
- Use top_p for nucleus sampling
- Set max_tokens to control response length
- Use frequency_penalty to reduce repetition
- Use presence_penalty to encourage topic diversity
- Implement stop sequences when appropriate

### Data Grounding (RAG Pattern)
- Index relevant data in Cognitive Search
- Retrieve relevant context for prompts
- Include source citations in responses
- Update knowledge base regularly
- Balance context length with relevance
- Implement semantic search for better retrieval

### Safety and Compliance
- Enable content filtering for harmful content
- Implement input validation
- Review generated content appropriately
- Handle sensitive data with care
- Monitor for bias and problematic outputs
- Implement user feedback mechanisms
