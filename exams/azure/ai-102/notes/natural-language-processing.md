- Language detection
- Personally identifiable information (PII) detection
- Text summarization
- Text classification

### Speech Processing with Azure AI Speech
- Text-to-speech (TTS) implementation
- Speech-to-text (STT) implementation
- Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
- Custom speech model implementation
- Intent recognition from speech
- Real-time speech translation
- Pronunciation assessment

### Language Translation
- Text and document translation with Translator service
- Custom translation model implementation
- Speech-to-speech translation
- Speech-to-text translation
- Text-to-speech translation

### Language Understanding Model
- Intent creation and utterance examples
- Entity creation (prebuilt, learned, list)
- Model training, testing, and publishing
- Language Understanding model optimization
- Consuming Language model from client apps
- Model backup and recovery
- Batch testing

### Question Answering Solution
- Knowledge base creation
- Source import to knowledge base (URLs, files)
- Knowledge base editing and curation
- Training and testing knowledge base
- Publishing knowledge base
- Multi-turn conversation implementation
- Alternate phrasing for questions
- Chit-chat personality addition
- Knowledge base export
- Multi-language question answering

### Language Translation
- Detect language before translation when needed
- Use custom translators for domain-specific terminology
- Preserve formatting in document translation
- Handle untranslatable content appropriately
- Implement profanity filtering when needed
- Cache common translations

### Language Understanding
- Provide diverse example utterances
- Use prebuilt entities when available
- Create composite entities for complex extraction
- Balance utterances across intents
- Implement active learning with suggestions
- Version models and test before production

### Question Answering
- Structure knowledge base logically
- Include variations of questions
- Use multi-turn for guided conversations
- Regularly update based on user feedback
- Test with real user questions
- Implement fallback responses
