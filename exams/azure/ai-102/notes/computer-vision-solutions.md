# Implement Computer Vision Solutions

## Overview
This domain covers analyzing images, implementing custom computer vision models, and analyzing videos using Azure AI Vision services. It represents 20-25% of the exam and focuses on extracting insights from visual content.

## Key Topics

### Image Analysis
- Visual feature selection for image processing
- Computer vision solutions for image tagging
- Face and facial feature identification
- Custom object identification in images
- Image type and classification identification
- Domain-specific content detection
- Landmark and celebrity detection

### Custom Computer Vision Models
- Choosing between image classification and object detection
- Image labeling for training data
- Custom image model training
- Model performance evaluation
- Custom vision model deployment and testing
- Model iteration management
- Transfer learning concepts

### Video Analysis
- Video Indexer for video analysis
- Insight extraction from videos (faces, brands, emotions, etc.)
- Video Indexer widget and API usage
- Custom Video Indexer model customization
- Video content moderation
- Video transcript and caption generation

## Services Reference

### Core Services
- Azure AI Vision (Computer Vision API)
- Azure AI Custom Vision
- Azure AI Video Indexer
- Azure AI Face API
- Form Recognizer (for document images)

### Supporting Services
- Azure Storage (for image/video storage)
- Azure Cognitive Search (for searchable image metadata)
- Azure Machine Learning (for advanced scenarios)
- Azure Functions (for event-driven processing)

## Best Practices

### Image Analysis
- Use appropriate image resolution (not too large or small)
- Select only needed visual features to optimize performance
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Cache results for repeated image analysis
- Handle sensitive content with content moderation
- Consider privacy implications of face detection

### Custom Model Training
- Collect diverse and representative training data
- Label images accurately and consistently
- Use at least 50 images per tag for classification
- Use at least 15 images per object for detection
- Balance training data across classes
- Use evaluation metrics to iterate on model quality
- Test model with real-world images

### Video Analysis
- Preprocess videos for optimal file size
- Use streaming upload for large videos
- Extract only needed insights to reduce processing time
- Implement webhooks for async processing completion
- Use Video Indexer widgets for easy embedding
- Cache indexed results to avoid reprocessing

### Performance and Cost
- Batch multiple images when possible
- Use appropriate image resolution for accuracy vs cost
- Implement client-side caching
- Choose right pricing tier based on volume
- Monitor API usage and throttling limits

## Common Scenarios

### Image Processing Use Cases
- Product catalog auto-tagging
- Content moderation for user uploads
- Accessibility features (image descriptions)
- Face verification for security
- Landmark recognition in travel apps
- Celebrity identification in media

### Custom Vision Applications
