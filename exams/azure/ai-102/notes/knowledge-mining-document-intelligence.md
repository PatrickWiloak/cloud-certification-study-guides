# Implement Knowledge Mining and Document Intelligence Solutions

## Overview
This domain covers implementing Azure Cognitive Search solutions with enrichment pipelines, and implementing Azure AI Document Intelligence for document processing. It represents 10-15% of the exam and focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured content.

## Key Topics

### Azure Cognitive Search Implementation
- Data source creation and configuration
- Index definition (fields, attributes, analyzers)
- Indexer creation and execution
- Index querying (syntax, sorting, filtering, wildcards)
- Knowledge Store projections (file, object, table)
- Search relevance tuning
- Faceted navigation implementation

### Enrichment Pipeline
- Cognitive Services account attachment to skillset
- Built-in skill selection for documents
- Custom skill implementation and integration
- Skillset design and configuration
- AI enrichment for content understanding
- Skill caching for cost optimization

### Azure AI Document Intelligence
- Prebuilt Document Intelligence models usage
- Custom Document Intelligence model implementation
- Model training, testing, and publishing
- Composed model creation
- Form field extraction
- Document structure analysis (tables, text)

## Services Reference

### Core Services
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Azure AI Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer)
- Azure Cognitive Services (for built-in skills)
- Azure Storage (for data and knowledge store)

### Supporting Services
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Table Storage
- Azure Data Lake Storage
- Azure Functions (for custom skills)
- Azure App Service (for custom skill hosting)

## Best Practices

### Search Index Design
- Choose appropriate field types and attributes
- Use analyzers for language-specific processing
- Implement suggester for autocomplete
- Design for query patterns you need to support
- Use scoring profiles to tune relevance
- Consider index size and query performance

### Data Source Configuration
- Schedule indexer runs appropriately
- Handle incremental updates efficiently
- Configure deletion detection for data source
- Monitor indexer execution and errors
- Use field mappings when needed
- Implement change tracking when available

### Skillset Development
- Use built-in skills when possible
- Cache enrichments to reduce costs
- Design custom skills for specialized needs
- Implement error handling in custom skills
- Test skills before production deployment
- Monitor skill execution performance

### Document Intelligence
- Choose appropriate prebuilt model when available
- Label sufficient training data for custom models
- Use consistent document formats for better accuracy
- Test model with various document variations
- Implement confidence threshold handling
- Version custom models appropriately
