- Enable MFA for all user accounts, especially privileged accounts
- Implement Conditional Access policies for risk-based authentication
- Use PIM for just-in-time administrative access
- Leverage Identity Protection for automated risk detection
- Implement password protection with banned password lists
- Use managed identities instead of service principal credentials

### Network Security

- Implement network segmentation with virtual networks and subnets
- Use NSGs and ASGs to control traffic flow
- Deploy Azure Firewall for centralized network security
- Enable DDoS Protection Standard for internet-facing resources
- Use Private Endpoints for secure access to PaaS services
- Implement Just-in-Time VM access to reduce attack surface

### Data Security

- Enable encryption at rest for all storage services
- Use customer-managed keys for sensitive data
- Implement encryption in transit with TLS 1.2 or higher
- Store secrets and keys in Azure Key Vault
- Enable soft delete and purge protection
- Use SAS tokens with minimal permissions and expiration

### Monitoring and Operations

- Enable Azure Monitor and diagnostic settings for all resources
- Centralize logs in Log Analytics workspace
- Deploy Microsoft Defender for Cloud for security posture management

  -Name "default" -VirtualMachine @(@{id="/subscriptions/.../myVM"; `
  ports=(@{number=22;protocol="*";allowedSourceAddressPrefix=@("*");maxRequestAccessDuration="PT3H"})})

# Create Conditional Access policy (requires Azure AD module)
New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy -DisplayName "Require MFA for admins"

# Get Key Vault secrets
Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName "MyKeyVault"
```

### KQL - Common Security Queries

```kql
// Failed sign-ins in last 24 hours
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ResultType != 0
| summarize FailedAttempts=count() by UserPrincipalName, IPAddress
| order by FailedAttempts desc

// Security alerts by severity
SecurityAlert
| summarize AlertCount=count() by AlertSeverity
| render piechart

// Top attacked resources
AzureActivity
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Failure"
| summarize FailureCount=count() by ResourceId
| top 10 by FailureCount

// Suspicious Key Vault access
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.KEYVAULT"
| where ResultType == "Unauthorized"
| project TimeGenerated, CallerIPAddress, OperationName
```
