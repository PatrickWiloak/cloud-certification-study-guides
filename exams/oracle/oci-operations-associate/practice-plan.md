- Mixing up alarm states (OK, FIRING, RESET)
- Confusing metric namespaces

### Operational
- Not checking prerequisites before changes
- Skipping backups before modifications
- Not testing in non-production first
- Ignoring cost implications

### Exam
- Rushing through questions
- Not reading all answer options
- Second-guessing correct answers
- Not managing time effectively

## Quick Reference

**Instance Lifecycle**:
```
Provisioning → Running → Stopping → Stopped
                ↓
           Terminating → Terminated
```

**Alarm States**:
- OK: Below threshold
- FIRING: Above threshold
- RESET: Was firing, now OK

**Log Retention**:
- Default: 30 days
- Configurable: Up to custom periods
- Archive to Object Storage for longer retention

**Backup Policies**:
- Bronze: Monthly backups
- Silver: Weekly backups
- Gold: Daily + weekly + monthly + yearly

**Budget Alert Thresholds**:
- Typical: 50%, 80%, 100%
- Can be ACTUAL or FORECAST

## Final Tips

1. **Hands-on is Key**: The exam tests practical operational knowledge
2. **Scenarios Matter**: Understand when to use which service/feature
3. **Read Carefully**: Look for keywords like "most secure", "lowest cost", "highest availability"
4. **Time Management**: Don't spend too long on any single question
5. **Stay Calm**: If stuck, flag and move on
6. **Trust Your Knowledge**: First instinct often correct

**Good luck with your OCI Operations Associate certification!**

Remember: Operations is about keeping things running smoothly, securely, and cost-effectively!
