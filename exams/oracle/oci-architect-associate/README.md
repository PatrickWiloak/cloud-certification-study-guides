- Database choice (Autonomous vs DB Systems, ATP vs ADW)
- HA design using ADs and fault domains
- IAM policy syntax and compartment design
- Hybrid connectivity options (FastConnect vs VPN)
- Load balancer configuration
- DR strategies and RTO/RPO requirements

### OCI Architecture Best Practices
- **Use availability domains**: Deploy across multiple ADs for HA
- **Leverage fault domains**: Anti-affinity within AD
- **Design compartments**: Logical isolation for projects/environments
- **Implement least privilege**: Fine-grained IAM policies
- **Enable encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Plan for DR**: Cross-region replication and backups
- **Monitor everything**: Metrics, logs, and alarms
- **Automate**: Use Terraform/Resource Manager

### Time Management
- 105 minutes for 60 questions = 1.75 minutes per question
- Read scenario questions carefully (may be longer)
- Flag uncertain questions for review
- Don't get stuck on difficult questions
- Leave 15-20 minutes for final review
