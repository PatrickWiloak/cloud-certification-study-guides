## Core Services Deep Dive

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Users:** Individual identities (employees, applications)
- **Groups:** Collections of users with similar access needs
- **Dynamic Groups:** Collections of resources (instances, functions) that match rules
- **Policies:** Rules defining who can access what resources
- **Compartments:** Logical containers for organizing resources
- **Identity Domains:** SAML 2.0 federation with external IdPs

**Policy Structure:**
```
Allow <subject> to <verb> <resource-type> in <location> where <conditions>
```

**Policy Verbs (Least to Most Privilege):**
1. **inspect:** List resources
2. **read:** View resource details
3. **use:** Use resource (e.g., attach volume)
4. **manage:** Full control (all operations)

**Common Policy Examples:**
```
# Allow developers to manage compute in Dev compartment
Allow group Developers to manage instance-family in compartment Dev

# Allow network admins to manage all networking
Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy

# Allow instances to read secrets from Vault
Allow dynamic-group AppServers to read secret-family in compartment Production

# Allow users to inspect all resources
Allow group Auditors to inspect all-resources in tenancy
```

**Dynamic Group Matching Rules:**
```
# Match all instances in a compartment
instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment...'

# Match instances with specific tags
tag.Environment.value = 'Production'

# Match multiple conditions (AND)
All {instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1...', tag.AppType.value = 'WebServer'}

# Match any condition (OR)
Any {instance.compartment.id = 'ocid1...', instance.compartment.id = 'ocid2...'}
```

### Networking Architecture

**VCN Design Principles:**
- Use /16 CIDR for VCN (65,536 addresses)
- Subnet public resources in /24 public subnets
- Subnet private resources in /24 private subnets
- Reserve address space for future growth
- Plan for VCN peering and hybrid connectivity

**VCN Components:**

**1. Subnets:**
- **Public Subnet:** Has route to Internet Gateway
- **Private Subnet:** No route to Internet Gateway
- Regional or AD-specific (regional recommended)
- CIDR block: /16 to /30

**2. Gateways:**

| Gateway Type | Purpose | Traffic Direction | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Internet Gateway (IGW) | Public internet access | Inbound + Outbound | Web servers, public APIs |
| NAT Gateway | Private internet access | Outbound only | Updates, patches, API calls |
| Service Gateway | Private OCI service access | Outbound only | Object Storage, Autonomous DB |
| Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) | On-premises connectivity | Bidirectional | VPN, FastConnect, peering |

**3. Peering:**

**Local Peering (Same Region):**
- Connect VCNs in same region
- Uses Local Peering Gateway (LPG)
- Private IP communication
- No bandwidth charges
- Setup: Create LPG in each VCN, establish connection

**Remote Peering (Different Regions):**
- Connect VCNs across regions
- Uses Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)
- Private IP communication
- Standard data transfer charges apply
- Setup: Create DRG in each VCN, establish Remote Peering Connection (RPC)

**Transit Routing:**
- Hub-and-spoke topology
- Central VCN acts as hub
- Spoke VCNs connect to hub via DRG
- Hub routes traffic between spokes and on-premises
- Use cases: Centralized firewall, shared services

**4. Load Balancing:**

**Load Balancer (Layer 7):**
- HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- SSL/TLS termination
- Path-based routing
- Session persistence (sticky sessions)
- Health checks
- WebSocket support
- Shapes: Flexible (bandwidth-based billing)

**Network Load Balancer (Layer 4):**
- TCP/UDP traffic
- High performance (millions of requests/sec)
- Ultra-low latency
- Preserve client IP address
- Health checks
- Use case: Non-HTTP protocols, extreme performance

**5. Security:**

**Security Lists (Subnet-Level):**
- Stateful firewall rules
- Apply to all resources in subnet
- Allow and deny rules
- Direction: Ingress and egress
- Default: Deny all

**Network Security Groups (Resource-Level):**
- Stateful firewall rules
- Apply to specific resources (VNICs)
- Allow rules only (implicit deny)
- More flexible than security lists
- Recommended for granular control

**Best Practice:** Use NSGs for resource-level security, keep security lists simple

## High Availability and Disaster Recovery

### High Availability Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Multi-AD Deployment**
```
Region: us-phoenix-1
â”œâ”€â”€ AD-1: Web tier (instances, load balancer)
â”œâ”€â”€ AD-2: Web tier (instances, load balancer)
â””â”€â”€ AD-3: Database (primary + standby with Data Guard)

Benefits:
- Protection against AD failure
- Load balancing across ADs
- Database failover capability
- RTO: Minutes, RPO: Near-zero
```

**Pattern 2: Single-AD with Fault Domains**
```
Region: us-ashburn-1
â””â”€â”€ AD-1
    â”œâ”€â”€ FD-1: Web tier instances
    â”œâ”€â”€ FD-2: Web tier instances
    â””â”€â”€ FD-3: Database instance

Benefits:
- Protection against rack/switch failure
- Cost-effective for single-AD regions
- RTO: Minutes, RPO: Last backup
```

**Pattern 3: Multi-Region Active-Passive**
```
Primary Region: us-phoenix-1
â”œâ”€â”€ Full application stack
â”œâ”€â”€ Database (primary)
â””â”€â”€ Cross-region backups to secondary region

Secondary Region: us-ashburn-1
â”œâ”€â”€ Standby resources (minimal)
â””â”€â”€ Database standby (Data Guard)

Benefits:
- Protection against region failure
- RTO: Hours, RPO: Minutes (with Data Guard)
- Lower secondary region cost
```

**Pattern 4: Multi-Region Active-Active**
```
Region 1: us-phoenix-1
â”œâ”€â”€ Full application stack
â””â”€â”€ Database (multi-region write)

Region 2: us-ashburn-1
â”œâ”€â”€ Full application stack
â””â”€â”€ Database (multi-region write)

Traffic Manager: Route users to nearest region

Benefits:
- No downtime during region failure
- Low latency (users routed to nearest region)
- RTO: None (always active), RPO: Near-zero
- Higher cost (fully duplicated)
```

### DR Strategies by RTO/RPO

| Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|-----|-----|------|------------|

- Watch for keywords: "most cost-effective", "highest availability", "most secure"

**2. Definition-Based:**
- Know exact definitions of services and features
- Understand differences between similar services (e.g., Security Lists vs NSGs)
- Memorize key numbers (compartment depth, CIDR ranges, retention periods)

**3. Best Practice:**
- Follow Oracle's documented best practices
- Choose answers aligned with Well-Architected Framework
- Select security-focused options when in doubt

**4. Troubleshooting:**

### Key Topics to Master

**High Priority (25-30% of exam):**
1. VCN design and networking (gateways, peering, routing)
2. IAM policies (syntax, verbs, resource-types)
3. Load balancing (types, configuration, health checks)
4. Compute (shapes, autoscaling, instance pools)
5. Storage (types, use cases, performance tiers)

**Medium Priority (20-25% of exam):**
1. Database services (Autonomous vs DB Systems, Data Guard)
2. Security (Vault, Cloud Guard, Security Zones, encryption)
3. Monitoring and logging (metrics, alarms, log types)
4. High availability patterns (multi-AD, fault domains)

3. Resource Manager (Terraform on OCI)
4. Specific service features (less commonly tested)

### Common Traps to Avoid

**1. Similar Answer Choices:**
- Read carefully to spot subtle differences
- Example: "Create Internet Gateway" vs "Create NAT Gateway"
- Choose based on specific requirement (inbound vs outbound-only)

**2. Over-Engineering:**
- Don't choose overly complex solutions
- Example: Multi-region active-active when multi-AD meets requirements
- Choose simplest solution that satisfies requirements

**3. Ignoring Constraints:**
- Pay attention to "most cost-effective", "highest availability", etc.
- Answer may be technically correct but not optimal
- Re-read question if multiple answers seem correct

**4. Assuming Defaults:**
- Know default behaviors (e.g., default security list rules)
- Understand when explicit configuration is needed
- Don't assume optional features are enabled
