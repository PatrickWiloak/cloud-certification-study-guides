## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
- Read questions carefully - OCI terminology differs from AWS/Azure
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first
- Look for keywords indicating specific services
- Consider cost, security, and high availability
- Remember that multiple answers may be "technically correct" but one is "most correct"

### Common Question Themes
- IAM policy syntax and effect
- Compartment hierarchy and inheritance
- VCN architecture and routing
- Autonomous Database features
- Storage tier selection
- High availability with ADs and fault domains
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization strategies

### OCI-Specific Concepts to Master
- **Tenancy vs Compartment**: Root container vs organizational units
- **Availability Domains**: Isolated data centers within a region
- **Fault Domains**: Anti-affinity within an AD
- **Security Lists vs NSGs**: Subnet-level vs resource-level security
- **Autonomous Database**: Self-managing database capabilities
- **Dynamic Groups**: IAM for resources (not just users)
- **Service Gateway**: Private access to Oracle services without internet

### Time Management
- 90 minutes for 60 questions = 1.5 minutes per question
- Flag uncertain questions for review
- Don't spend more than 2 minutes on any single question
- Leave 10-15 minutes at the end for review

## 📈 Success Criteria

- Understand cloud computing fundamentals and OCI value proposition
- Explain OCI architecture: regions, ADs, fault domains, compartments
- Identify appropriate compute, storage, and networking services
- Understand IAM components and policy structure
- Recognize security best practices and services
- Demonstrate knowledge of database options
- Understand basic cost management and pricing models
- Apply observability and monitoring concepts
