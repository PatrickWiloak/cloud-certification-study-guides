**Availability Domains (ADs):**
- One or more isolated data centers within a region
- Physically separated (different buildings, power, cooling)
- 1-3 ADs per region
- AD numbers are customer-specific (randomized)

- Purpose: Protection against hardware failures

### Organizational Structure

**Tenancy:**

- Home region (cannot be changed)
- Billing entity

**Compartments:**
- Logical containers for organizing resources
- Maximum depth: 6 levels (root + 5 nested)

### Scenario 2: Compartment Design
**Question:** How to organize resources for multiple projects and environments
**Answer:** Create compartment hierarchy by project, then by environment (dev/test/prod)

**Example:**
```
Tenancy
├── Project-A
│   ├── Dev
│   ├── Test
│   └── Prod
└── Project-B
    ├── Dev

- **Archive Storage:** Rarely accessed, long-term retention
- **File Storage:** Shared file system (NFS)

### Scenario 4: Network Security
**Question:** Allow web traffic to public subnet, block everything else
**Answer:** Configure security list or NSG with allow rule for ports 80/443, implicit deny for rest

**Security rules:**
- Ingress: Allow TCP 80, 443 from 0.0.0.0/0
- Egress: Allow all (or specific as needed)
- Default: Deny all (implicit)

### Scenario 5: IAM Policy
**Question:** Allow developers to manage compute instances in Dev compartment
**Answer:** `Allow group Developers to manage instance-family in compartment Dev`

## Common Gotchas

**Architecture:**
- ❌ AD numbers are the same for all customers → ✅ AD numbers are customer-specific
- ❌ Compartments can be 10 levels deep → ✅ Maximum 6 levels
- ❌ Tenancy home region can be changed → ✅ Home region is permanent

**Networking:**
- ❌ Security lists are resource-level → ✅ Security lists are subnet-level (NSGs are resource-level)
- ❌ NAT Gateway allows inbound traffic → ✅ NAT is outbound-only
- ❌ Service Gateway requires internet access → ✅ Service Gateway is private (no internet)

**IAM:**
- ❌ Dynamic Groups contain users → ✅ Dynamic Groups contain resources
- ❌ 'use' verb gives full access → ✅ 'manage' verb gives full access

**Storage:**
- ❌ Archive Storage has instant retrieval → ✅ Archive has ~1 hour retrieval time
- ❌ Block Volume is for unstructured data → ✅ Block Volume is for structured data (boot/data disks)
