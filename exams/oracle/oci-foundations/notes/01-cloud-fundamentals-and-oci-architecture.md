## OCI Architecture Overview

### Global Infrastructure

OCI's global infrastructure is designed for high availability, low latency, and maximum security.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **40+ regions** worldwide (as of 2024)
- **Multiple availability domains** per region (where possible)
- **Fault domains** within each availability domain
- **Low-latency networking** between regions
- **Isolated network virtualization**

**Design Principles**:
1. **Isolation**: Each region is independent and isolated
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple levels of redundancy (regions, ADs, FDs)
3. **Security**: Security built into every layer
4. **Performance**: High-speed, low-latency network
5. **Scalability**: Designed to scale globally

### Regions

**Definition**: A localized geographic area containing one or more availability domains.

**Characteristics**:
- Independent and isolated from other regions
- Data residency and compliance boundary
- Connected via OCI's high-speed backbone network
- Services may vary by region
- Each region has a unique identifier (e.g., us-phoenix-1, us-ashburn-1)

**Region Types**:

#### 1. Multi-AD Regions (Preferred)
- Contains **3 availability domains**
- Highest level of availability
- Examples: Phoenix, Ashburn, Frankfurt, London, Tokyo

**Benefits**:
- Withstand complete AD failure
- Distribute workloads across ADs
- Built-in disaster recovery

#### 2. Single-AD Regions
- Contains **1 availability domain**
- 3 fault domains within the AD
- Examples: Some government and smaller regions

**Use Cases**:
- Data sovereignty requirements
- Specific geographic presence needed
- Cost optimization for non-critical workloads

#### Realm Types

**1. Commercial Realms**:
- Standard OCI public cloud
- Global regions
- Full service availability

**2. Government Realms**:
- **OCI Government Cloud**: For US government (FedRAMP authorized)
- **UK Government Cloud**: For UK public sector
- Enhanced security and compliance
- Physical and logical isolation

**Region Naming Convention**:
```
[country-code]-[city]-[number]

Examples:
- us-phoenix-1
- us-ashburn-1
- eu-frankfurt-1
- ap-tokyo-1
- uk-london-1
```

**Region Selection Considerations**:
1. **Latency**: Choose region closest to users
2. **Data Residency**: Comply with data sovereignty laws
3. **Service Availability**: Verify required services are available
4. **Cost**: Pricing may vary by region
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Select paired regions for DR

### Availability Domains (ADs)

**Definition**: One or more isolated, fault-tolerant data centers within a region.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Physically separated**: Different buildings, different power, different cooling
- **Independent**: Failure in one AD doesn't affect others
- **Low-latency connectivity**: Connected within region via high-speed network
- **Resource distribution**: Resources can span ADs

**Numbering**:
- ADs are numbered: AD-1, AD-2, AD-3
- AD numbers are customer-specific (randomized mapping)
- Your AD-1 may be different physical AD than another customer's AD-1

**Purpose**:
- Provide redundancy and fault tolerance
- Enable high availability architectures
- Protect against data center failures

**Best Practices**:
```
High Availability Pattern:
- Deploy resources across multiple ADs
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic
- Replicate data across ADs

Example Architecture:
AD-1: Web Server 1, Database Primary
AD-2: Web Server 2, Database Standby
AD-3: Web Server 3, Database Backup
```

**AD Availability**:
- Multi-AD regions: 3 ADs
- Single-AD regions: 1 AD (with 3 fault domains)

### Fault Domains (FDs)

**Definition**: Grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **3 fault domains per availability domain**
- Logical grouping of hardware
- Separate physical hardware (servers, switches, racks)
- Share availability domain infrastructure
- Protect against hardware failures

**Purpose**:
- Provide redundancy within an AD
- Protect against rack/hardware failures
- Enable high availability in single-AD regions

**Fault Domain Placement**:
- OCI automatically distributes resources across FDs
- You can manually select FD for specific resources
- Load balancers automatically use multiple FDs

**FD vs AD Comparison**:

| Feature | Availability Domain | Fault Domain |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Scope | Region level | AD level |
| Physical Separation | Different buildings | Different racks/hardware |
| Count | 1-3 per region | 3 per AD |
| Failure Protection | Data center failure | Hardware/rack failure |
| Network | Separate networks | Shared AD network |
| Best For | DR and HA | Additional redundancy |

**High Availability Architecture**:
```
Region: us-phoenix-1
├── AD-1
│   ├── FD-1: Instance-1
│   ├── FD-2: Instance-2
│   └── FD-3: Instance-3
├── AD-2
│   ├── FD-1: Instance-4
│   ├── FD-2: Instance-5
│   └── FD-3: Instance-6
└── AD-3
    ├── FD-1: Instance-7
    ├── FD-2: Instance-8
    └── FD-3: Instance-9
```
