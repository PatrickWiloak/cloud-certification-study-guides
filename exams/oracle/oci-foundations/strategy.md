## Exam Day Strategy

### Before the Exam

**Day Before:**
- Light review only (cram sheet)
- Get good sleep (8+ hours)
- Don't study new material
- Relax and build confidence

**Exam Day:**
- Eat a good meal 1-2 hours before
- Arrive 15 minutes early (testing center) or test setup (online)
- Have valid ID ready
- Clear workspace (online exams)

### During the Exam

**Time Management:**
- 90 minutes ÷ 60 questions = 1.5 minutes per question
- First pass: Answer all questions you know (60-70 minutes)
- Second pass: Review flagged questions (20-25 minutes)
- Final pass: Quick review of all (5 minutes)

**Question Strategy:**
1. **Read carefully:** Look for keywords (MOST, LEAST, NOT, etc.)
2. **Eliminate wrong answers:** Often 2 options are clearly incorrect
3. **Look for OCI-specific:** Choose OCI services over general approaches
4. **Consider all aspects:** Cost, security, availability, performance
5. **Trust your preparation:** First instinct is often correct

**Question Keywords:**
- **"MOST cost-effective"** → Always Free, Serverless, Object Storage
- **"High availability"** → Multi-AD, Load Balancer, replicas
- **"Secure"** → Private, IAM policies, Vault, NSGs
- **"Best practice"** → OCI recommendations, managed services
- **"Minimum administrative overhead"** → Managed services (Autonomous DB)

### Common Question Patterns

**Pattern 1: Service Selection**
- Question describes a scenario
- Choose appropriate OCI service
- **Tip:** Match requirements to service capabilities

**Pattern 2: Architecture Design**
- Design system meeting specific requirements (HA, cost, security)
- **Tip:** Think multi-AD, load balancers, proper compartment design

**Pattern 3: IAM Policy**
- Write or identify correct policy
- **Tip:** Follow syntax: Allow <who> to <verb> <resource> in <where>

**Pattern 4: Troubleshooting**
- Identify misconfiguration or solution to problem
- **Tip:** Think systematic: network, security, IAM, service config

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Study Pitfalls

1. **Skipping hands-on:** Exam tests practical understanding
2. **Memorizing without understanding:** Know WHY, not just WHAT
3. **Focusing only on one resource:** Use multiple study materials
4. **Ignoring weak topics:** Address all exam domains
5. **Not taking practice exams:** Essential for readiness assessment

### Exam Pitfalls

1. **Rushing through questions:** Use full time allotted
2. **Changing answers without reason:** First instinct often correct
3. **Leaving questions blank:** No penalty for wrong answers - guess if needed
4. **Overthinking:** Don't read too much into questions
5. **Ignoring keywords:** "MOST," "LEAST," "BEST" are critical
