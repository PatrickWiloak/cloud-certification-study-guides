## Development Best Practices

### AWS SDK Best Practices
1. **Use IAM roles** instead of access keys for credentials
2. **Implement exponential backoff with jitter** for retries
3. **Use connection pooling** - reuse SDK clients
4. **Set appropriate timeouts** for API calls
5. **Handle throttling** - implement retry logic for rate limiting
6. **Use pagination** for list operations (DynamoDB Scan, S3 ListObjects)
7. **Enable SDK logging** for debugging
8. **Explicitly set regions** - avoid relying on defaults

### Lambda Development Best Practices
1. **Minimize cold starts:**
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Use Lambda layers for shared dependencies
   - Consider provisioned concurrency for critical functions
2. **Optimize memory allocation** - right-size based on performance tests
3. **Use environment variables** for configuration (encrypt sensitive data)
4. **Implement connection reuse:**
   - Initialize SDK clients outside handler
   - Use database connection pooling (RDS Proxy)
5. **Set appropriate timeouts** - default is 3 seconds, max is 15 minutes
6. **Use Lambda layers** for shared code and dependencies
7. **Implement structured logging** with JSON format
8. **Use Lambda destinations** for async event handling

### DynamoDB Best Practices
1. **Design for access patterns** - know your queries first
2. **Choose effective partition keys:**
   - High cardinality (many distinct values)
   - Uniform access patterns (avoid hot partitions)
   - Use composite keys when needed
3. **Use GSI for alternate access patterns**
4. **Avoid scans** - use Query instead when possible
5. **Implement pagination** for large result sets
6. **Use batch operations** - BatchGetItem, BatchWriteItem (up to 25 items)
7. **Use transactions** for ACID requirements (TransactWriteItems, TransactGetItems)
8. **Enable DynamoDB Streams** for change data capture
9. **Use on-demand billing** for unpredictable workloads

### API Gateway Best Practices
1. **Enable caching** to reduce backend calls
2. **Implement throttling** to protect backend services
3. **Use Lambda proxy integration** for simplified development
4. **Validate requests** at the API Gateway layer
5. **Enable CORS** for cross-origin requests
6. **Use custom domain names** with ACM certificates
7. **Implement API keys and usage plans** for tiered access
8. **Use request/response transformations** when needed
9. **Enable CloudWatch Logs** for debugging

### Security Best Practices
1. **Principle of least privilege** - grant minimum required permissions
2. **Never hardcode credentials** - use IAM roles, Secrets Manager
3. **Encrypt data at rest and in transit** - use KMS, TLS/SSL
4. **Rotate credentials regularly** - automate with Secrets Manager
5. **Validate all inputs** - prevent injection attacks
6. **Use VPCs and security groups** for network isolation
7. **Enable CloudTrail** for audit logging
8. **Implement MFA** for sensitive operations
9. **Use resource-based policies** for cross-account access

## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - identify key requirements and constraints
2. **Look for AWS best practices** - choose the most "AWS-native" solution
3. **Consider cost optimization** - when multiple solutions work, choose the most cost-effective
4. **Think about scale** - solutions should scale automatically
5. **Eliminate wrong answers** - often 2 choices can be ruled out immediately
6. **Watch for keywords:**
   - "Most cost-effective" â†’ serverless, on-demand pricing
   - "Minimum operational overhead" â†’ managed services
   - "Decoupled" â†’ SQS, SNS, EventBridge
   - "Real-time" â†’ Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams
   - "Secure" â†’ IAM roles, encryption, least privilege

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing IAM policies (identity-based vs resource-based)
- Not understanding Lambda execution model and limits
- Misunderstanding DynamoDB partition key design
- Forgetting about VPC configuration for Lambda accessing RDS
- Not knowing when to use SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge
- Overlooking CloudFormation intrinsic functions
- Not understanding API Gateway integration types

### Time Management
- 130 minutes for 65 questions = 2 minutes per question
- Flag uncertain questions for review
- Don't spend more than 3 minutes on any single question
- Leave 15-20 minutes for review at the end
