   - Complete AWS labs and tutorials

### Phase 3: Exam Preparation (1-2 weeks)
1. **Practice Exams**
   - Take multiple practice tests
   - Review incorrect answers thoroughly
   - Identify knowledge gaps

2. **Final Review**
   - Review cheat sheets and summaries
   - Practice scenario-based questions
   - One-page cram sheet review

## üß† Exam Tactics

### Question Strategy
1. **Read Carefully**: Identify the key requirements and constraints
2. **Eliminate**: Remove obviously incorrect answers first
3. **Keywords**: Look for specific service mentions or requirements
4. **Cost vs Performance**: Balance optimization requirements
5. **AWS Native**: Prefer AWS services over third-party when possible

### Time Management
- **2 minutes per question** average
- **Flag and move**: Don't spend too long on difficult questions
- **Review time**: Reserve 15-20 minutes for flagged questions
- **Quick wins**: Answer easy questions first to build confidence

### Common Patterns
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployments
- **Scalability**: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing
- **Security**: Least privilege, encryption, VPC isolation
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sizing, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances
- **Performance**: CloudFront, ElastiCache, read replicas

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Study Mistakes
- Memorizing service details instead of understanding use cases
- Skipping hands-on practice
- Not understanding service integration
- Focusing only on happy path scenarios

### Exam Mistakes
- Not reading questions carefully
- Overthinking simple questions
- Choosing complex solutions when simple ones work
- Ignoring cost optimization requirements
- Not considering compliance/security requirements

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1-2**: Complete foundation topics, basic hands-on
- **Week 3-4**: Architecture patterns, advanced services
- **Week 5-6**: Practice exams, gap analysis
- **Week 7**: Final review, exam scheduling

### Self-Assessment Questions
- Can I design a basic 3-tier web application on AWS?
- Do I understand the differences between storage options?
- Can I secure an application using IAM and VPC?
- Do I know when to use which database service?
- Can I optimize costs while maintaining performance?
