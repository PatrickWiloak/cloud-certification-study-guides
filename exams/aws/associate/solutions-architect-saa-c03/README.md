## Exam Tips

### Question Strategy
1. **Read carefully** - identify key requirements (HA, cost, performance, security)
2. **Look for keywords:**
   - "Most cost-effective" → Reserved Instances, Spot, serverless, lifecycle policies
   - "Least operational overhead" → Managed services, serverless
   - "Highly available" → Multi-AZ, Auto Scaling, load balancing
   - "Fault tolerant" → Multiple AZs, regions, automatic failover
   - "Secure" → IAM roles, encryption, private subnets, least privilege
   - "Best performance" → Caching, read replicas, provisioned IOPS
3. **Apply Well-Architected principles** - most answers align with the framework
4. **Eliminate wrong answers** - often 2 choices are clearly incorrect
5. **Choose AWS-native solutions** - prefer AWS services over third-party when appropriate

### Common Pitfalls
- Confusing security groups (stateful) vs NACLs (stateless)
- Not understanding S3 storage class use cases
- Forgetting Multi-AZ ≠ Multi-Region
- Misunderstanding IAM policy evaluation logic
- Overlooking VPC endpoints for cost savings
- Choosing complex solutions when simple ones work
- Not considering operational overhead differences

### Time Management
- 130 minutes for 65 questions = 2 minutes per question
- Flag uncertain questions and return later
- Don't spend more than 3 minutes on any question initially
- Leave 15-20 minutes for review
