### Decoupling Patterns
- **Queues**: SQS for async processing
- **Topics**: SNS for fan-out
- **Event Bus**: EventBridge for event-driven
- **API Gateway**: Decouple frontend from backend
- **Load Balancers**: Decouple clients from servers

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

## Well-Architected Framework Pillars

### Operational Excellence
- Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation)
- Automated deployments (CodePipeline)
- Small, frequent changes
- Learn from failures
- CloudWatch for monitoring

### Security
- IAM for identity and access
- Detective controls (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty)
- Infrastructure protection (VPC, Security Groups)
- Data protection (encryption, backups)
- Incident response procedures

### Reliability
- Automatic recovery from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally
- Stop guessing capacity (Auto Scaling)
- Manage change through automation

### Performance Efficiency
- Use advanced technologies (serverless, ML)
- Go global in minutes (CloudFront, Global Accelerator)
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Mechanical sympathy (right tools for the job)

### Cost Optimization
- Implement Cloud Financial Management
- Adopt consumption model (pay for what you use)
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending on undifferentiated work
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

### Sustainability
- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce downstream impact

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring Keywords
- "Cost-effective" ≠ "best performance"
- "Most secure" may mean more encryption, even if more complex
- "Minimize operational overhead" → managed services

### 2. Over-Engineering
- Don't choose complex multi-region when single region suffices
- Don't pick Spot when availability is critical
- Start simple, then optimize

### 3. Missing Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region
- **Multi-AZ**: High availability, automatic failover, same region
- **Multi-Region**: Disaster recovery, compliance, global performance

### 4. Forgetting About Managed Services
- AWS prefers managed services over DIY
- RDS > self-managed DB on EC2
- ALB > HAProxy on EC2
- ElastiCache > self-managed Redis

### 5. Not Reading Full Question
- Easy to miss "NOT" or "EXCEPT" in questions
- Last sentence often has critical requirement
- All constraints matter (cost, performance, security)

## Final Tips

1. **Trust your preparation**: Don't second-guess too much
2. **AWS wants you to pass**: Questions are fair, not trick questions
3. **Manage time**: Don't spend too long on any question
4. **Eliminate obviously wrong**: Narrow down choices
5. **Best practices matter**: AWS prefers managed services, Multi-AZ, encryption
6. **Read every word**: Details in scenarios are important
7. **Stay calm**: Take a deep breath, flag and move on if stuck
8. **Use process of elimination**: Often 2-3 answers are clearly wrong
9. **Consider operational overhead**: Simpler is often better (unless performance required)
10. **When in doubt**: Choose the most AWS-native, managed service option

**Remember**: You need 720/1000 (72%) to pass. You don't need perfection!

Good luck on your SAA-C03 exam!
