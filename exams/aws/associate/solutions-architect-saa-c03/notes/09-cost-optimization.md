**[ðŸ“– AWS Cost Optimization Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html)** - Run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

## EC2 Cost Optimization

**[ðŸ“– EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)** - Understand EC2 pricing models

### EC2 Pricing Models

**On-Demand**:
- Pay per hour or second
- No commitment
- Highest cost
- Use Case: Short-term, unpredictable workloads

**Reserved Instances (RI)**:
- 1 or 3-year commitment
- Up to 72% discount vs On-Demand
- **Standard RI**: Highest discount, cannot change instance type
- **Convertible RI**: Change instance family, lower discount
- **Payment**: All upfront, partial upfront, no upfront
- Use Case: Steady-state workloads

**[ðŸ“– Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-reserved-instances.html)** - Save up to 72% with long-term commitments

**Savings Plans**:
- 1 or 3-year commitment
- Up to 72% discount
- **Compute Savings Plan**: Flexible across instance family, region, OS
- **EC2 Instance Savings Plan**: Flexible within instance family
- Use Case: Predictable usage with flexibility

**[ðŸ“– Savings Plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html)** - Flexible pricing model for compute usage

**Spot Instances**:
- Up to 90% discount
- Can be terminated with 2-minute warning
- Spot Request: One-time or persistent
- **Spot Fleet**: Mix of Spot and On-Demand
- Use Case: Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads (batch, data analysis, CI/CD)

**Dedicated Hosts**:
- Physical server dedicated to you
- Socket/core visibility for licensing
- Most expensive option
- Use Case: Regulatory, licensing requirements

**Dedicated Instances**:
- Instances on dedicated hardware
- May share hardware with other instances in account
- Cheaper than Dedicated Hosts
- No access to underlying hardware

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Right-Sizing**:
- Use Compute Optimizer recommendations
- Analyze CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Downsize over-provisioned instances
- Match instance type to workload

**Instance Lifecycle**:
- Stop instances during off-hours
- Terminate unused instances
- Use Auto Scaling to match demand
- Schedule start/stop with Systems Manager

**Purchasing Options Mix**:
- Reserved/Savings Plans for baseline
- On-Demand for variability
- Spot for batch and fault-tolerant workloads
- Aim for 60-80% Reserved/Savings coverage

## Storage Cost Optimization

**[ðŸ“– S3 Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.html)** - Optimize storage costs with the right storage class

### S3 Storage Classes

**Pricing** (per GB, cheapest to most expensive):
1. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: $0.00099/GB (~$1/TB)
2. **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: $0.0036/GB (~$3.60/TB)
3. **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: $0.004/GB (~$4/TB)
4. **S3 One Zone-IA**: $0.01/GB (~$10/TB)
5. **S3 Standard-IA**: $0.0125/GB (~$12.50/TB)
6. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: $0.023/GB (~$23/TB) + monitoring
7. **S3 Standard**: $0.023/GB (~$23/TB)

**Lifecycle Policies**:
- Automatically transition objects between storage classes
- Delete old versions or expired objects
- Reduce costs for infrequently accessed data

**Example Lifecycle**:
```
0-30 days: S3 Standard
30-90 days: S3 Standard-IA
90-365 days: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
365+ days: S3 Glacier Deep Archive
```

**S3 Intelligent-Tiering**:
- Automatic cost optimization
- No retrieval fees for frequent/infrequent tiers
- 4 tiers: Frequent, Infrequent (30 days), Archive (90 days), Deep Archive (180 days)
- Small monitoring fee per object
- Use Case: Unknown or changing access patterns

### EBS Cost Optimization

**Volume Types**:
- **gp3**: Cheaper than gp2, provision IOPS/throughput independently
- **st1/sc1**: Cheaper for throughput-optimized workloads
- Delete old snapshots
- Resize volumes to actual usage

**Strategies**:
- Use gp3 instead of gp2 (20% cheaper)
- Delete unattached volumes
- Use snapshot lifecycle policies
- Stop instances instead of keeping running with attached EBS

### EFS Cost Optimization
- **EFS Standard-IA**: 92% cheaper than Standard
- Lifecycle management: Move to IA after 7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 days
- **One Zone storage classes**: 47% savings (if AZ redundancy not required)
- Elastic throughput for variable workloads

## Database Cost Optimization

### RDS Strategies
- **Reserved Instances**: 1 or 3-year commitment
- **Aurora Serverless v2**: Pay per second, auto-scaling
- **Right-size instances**: Use CloudWatch metrics
- **Stop dev/test instances** during off-hours
- **Read Replicas**: Offload read traffic from primary

### DynamoDB Strategies
- **On-Demand**: Unpredictable traffic (pay per request)
- **Provisioned**: Predictable traffic (pre-purchase capacity)
- **Reserved Capacity**: 1-year commitment for provisioned
- **Auto Scaling**: Match capacity to demand
- **TTL**: Automatically delete expired items
- **DAX**: Reduce read costs by caching

### Redshift Strategies
- **Reserved Nodes**: Up to 75% discount
- **Serverless**: Pay for usage, no cluster management
- **Pause/Resume**: Dev/test clusters
- **Spectrum**: Query S3 data directly (avoid loading all data)

## Data Transfer Costs

### Data Transfer Pricing
- **Inbound**: FREE (data coming into AWS)
- **Outbound to Internet**: $0.09/GB (varies by region)
- **Between AZs**: $0.01-0.02/GB
- **Between Regions**: $0.02/GB
- **CloudFront to Internet**: $0.085/GB (slightly cheaper + better performance)
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration**: Additional $0.04-0.08/GB

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**CloudFront**:
- Use CloudFront to reduce data transfer costs
- Cache at edge locations
- Regional edge caches reduce origin fetches

**S3 Transfer Acceleration**:
- Only when speed matters
- Disable if not needed

**VPC Endpoints**:

## Exam Tips

### Common Cost Optimization Scenarios
- **Steady-state workload**: Reserved Instances or Savings Plans
- **Batch processing, fault-tolerant**: Spot Instances
- **Spiky, unpredictable**: On-Demand + Auto Scaling
- **Infrequent S3 access**: S3 IA or Intelligent-Tiering
- **Long-term archive**: S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- **Reduce data transfer**: CloudFront, VPC Endpoints
- **Right-size resources**: Compute Optimizer
- **Unused resources**: Delete unattached EBS, old snapshots, idle load balancers

### Key Decision Points
1. Workload predictability â†’ Pricing model
2. Access pattern â†’ Storage class
3. Fault tolerance â†’ Spot viability
4. Data transfer volume â†’ Transfer strategy
5. Idle periods â†’ Auto Scaling or scheduled stop/start

### Cost vs Performance Trade-offs
- **Lower RTO/RPO**: Higher cost (multi-site vs backup)
- **Higher availability**: Higher cost (multi-AZ)
- **Better performance**: Higher cost (Provisioned IOPS, larger instances)
- Balance based on business requirements

### Common Pitfalls
- Unused Elastic IPs ($0.005/hour)
- Unattached EBS volumes
- Old EBS snapshots
- Data transfer between AZs
- Over-provisioned resources
- NAT Gateway charges (use VPC endpoints when possible)
- Load balancers with no targets
