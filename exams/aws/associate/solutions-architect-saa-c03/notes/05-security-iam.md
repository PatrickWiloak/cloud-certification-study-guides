# AWS Security and IAM - SAA-C03

## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**[ðŸ“– AWS IAM Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/)** - Securely control access to AWS services and resources

### Core Components

**[ðŸ“– IAM Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html)** - Users, groups, and roles in IAM

**Users**: Individual people or applications
- Long-term credentials (password, access keys)
- Programmatic access (access key ID + secret key)
- Console access (username + password)
- MFA enforcement

**Groups**: Collection of users
- Assign permissions to multiple users
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- No default group

**Roles**: Temporary credentials for AWS services or federated users
- No long-term credentials
- Assumed by entities (EC2, Lambda, users)
- Cross-account access
- Federation (SAML, OIDC)

**Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions
- Identity-based (attached to users, groups, roles)
- Resource-based (attached to resources like S3 buckets)
- AWS managed, customer managed, inline

### Policy Structure

**[ðŸ“– IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)** - Control access with policies

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow" | "Deny",
      "Action": ["service:action"],
      "Resource": ["arn"],
      "Condition": {
        "condition-operator": {"condition-key": "value"}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Policy Evaluation Logic
1. **Explicit Deny**: Always wins
2. **Explicit Allow**: Required if no deny
3. **Default Deny**: Implicit deny if no allow

**Evaluation Order**:
1. Organization SCPs (deny override)
2. Resource-based policies
3. IAM permission boundaries
4. Session policies
5. Identity-based policies

### IAM Best Practices
1. Root account: Use only for account setup, enable MFA
2. Least privilege: Grant minimum permissions
3. One IAM user per person: No sharing credentials
4. Strong password policy: Length, complexity, rotation
5. Enable MFA for privileged users
6. Use roles for applications on EC2
7. Rotate credentials regularly
8. Remove unnecessary users and credentials
9. Use policy conditions for extra security
10. Monitor IAM activity with CloudTrail

### IAM Access Analyzer
- Identify resources shared with external entities
- Validates IAM policies
- Generates least-privilege policies
- Use Case: Security audits, compliance

## AWS Organizations

**[ðŸ“– AWS Organizations Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/)** - Centrally manage multiple AWS accounts

### Features
- **Consolidated Billing**: Single payment for all accounts
- **Volume Discounts**: Aggregated usage
- **OU (Organizational Units)**: Hierarchical account grouping
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Permission boundaries

**[ðŸ“– Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html)** - Set permission guardrails across accounts

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- **Allowlist**: Explicitly allow services (default deny all)
- **Denylist**: Explicitly deny services (default allow all)
- Applied to OUs or accounts
- Does NOT apply to management account
- Limit permissions, does not grant

**SCP Example** (Deny S3):
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

### Best Practices
- Separate accounts for dev, test, prod
- Centralize logging account
- Security account for GuardDuty, Security Hub
- Restrict root account access with SCPs
- Tag resources for cost allocation

## Encryption

**[ðŸ“– Encryption in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-aws-security/encryption-in-aws.html)** - Data protection at rest and in transit

### Encryption at Rest

**S3 Encryption**:
- **SSE-S3**: S3-managed keys (AES-256)
- **SSE-KMS**: KMS-managed keys, audit trail
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys
- **Client-side**: Encrypt before upload

**EBS Encryption**:
- KMS keys (CMK)
- Encrypted snapshots
- Enabled by default option
- Cannot change encryption state (must copy)

**RDS Encryption**:
- KMS encryption
- Includes backups, snapshots, read replicas
- Cannot enable after creation (must snapshot + restore)

### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS/SSL**: HTTPS for web traffic
- **VPN**: IPsec tunnels
- **Direct Connect**: MACsec (layer 2) or VPN over DX

### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

**[ðŸ“– AWS KMS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/)** - Managed encryption key creation and control

**Customer Master Keys (CMKs)**:
- **AWS Managed**: Free, rotated automatically every year
- **Customer Managed**: $1/month, manual rotation
- **Symmetric (AES-256)**: Single key for encrypt/decrypt
- **Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)**: Public/private key pair

**Key Policies**:
- Primary resource-based policy
- Required for all CMKs
- Grants and IAM policies for additional access

**Envelope Encryption**:
- Encrypt data with data key
- Encrypt data key with CMK
- Performance: Large data encrypted locally
- `GenerateDataKey` API

**KMS Limits**:
- API call quotas (5,500-30,000 req/sec depending on region)
- Use envelope encryption or DEK caching to reduce calls
