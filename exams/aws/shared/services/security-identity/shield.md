    message = json.loads(event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'])

    if message['AlarmName'] == 'DDoSAttackDetected':
        # Get attack details
        attacks = shield.list_attacks(
            StartTime=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=1),
            EndTime=datetime.utcnow()

            Message=f'DDoS attack detected. Latest attacks: {attacks["AttackSummaries"]}'
        )

        # Trigger additional security measures
        # e.g., increase WAF rate limits, scale infrastructure, etc.

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('DDoS response executed successfully')
    }
