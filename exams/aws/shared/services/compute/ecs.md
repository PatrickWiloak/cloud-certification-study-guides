### ECS Network Modes

**[📖 ECS Network Modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)** - Comprehensive networking guide

ECS network modes determine how containers within a task communicate with each other, with other services, and with the underlying host network. Each network mode configures the networking environment differently, impacting security, connectivity, and control.

#### 1. None Network Mode

**What it does**: Containers have **no external network connectivity**. They cannot communicate with other containers, services, or the internet.

**Key Characteristics:**
- No external network interfaces assigned
- Port mappings cannot be specified
- Containers can only communicate within the same task via **localhost**
- Maximum network isolation

**Use Cases:**
- Isolated, compute-intensive batch workloads (data processing, rendering)
- Tasks requiring maximum network isolation for security
- Workloads with no external communication needs

**Limitations:**
- No external connectivity limits use for networked applications
- Not suitable for microservices requiring inter-service communication
- Cannot host web servers or APIs

**Example Task Definition:**
```json
{
  "family": "isolated-batch-job",
  "networkMode": "none",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "batch-processor",
      "image": "my-batch-app:latest",
      "memory": 512,
      "cpu": 256
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Bridge Network Mode

**What it does**: Containers use **Docker's built-in virtual network** (Docker bridge) on the host EC2 instance. Docker manages port mappings to route traffic.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Containers get private IPs within Docker bridge network
- Port mappings required to expose services (e.g., container port 80 → host port 8080)
- Security groups applied at **EC2 instance level**, not per task
- Containers on same host communicate via Docker bridge
- **[📖 Bridge Mode Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-bridge.html)**

**Use Cases:**
- Legacy applications not requiring advanced networking
- Simple workloads without fine-grained network control needs
- Development/testing environments prioritizing simplicity
- Applications where multiple containers share host networking

**Limitations:**
- Limited network isolation (containers share host network stack)
- Security groups apply to entire EC2 instance, not individual tasks
- Complex port management with overlapping ports
- Less secure for multi-tenant or sensitive workloads

**Example Task Definition:**
```json
{
  "family": "web-app-bridge",
  "networkMode": "bridge",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "web-server",
      "image": "nginx:latest",
      "memory": 512,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 8080,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Host Network Mode

**What it does**: Containers **bypass Docker's virtual network** and directly use the **host EC2 instance's network interface**.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Containers share host's IP address and network stack
- No network abstraction layer
- Port mappings not needed (containers use host ports directly)
- Security groups at **EC2 instance level**
- Cannot run multiple instances of same task on single host (port conflicts)
- **[📖 Host Mode Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-host.html)**

**Use Cases:**
- High-performance applications requiring direct network access
- Low-latency network services (real-time analytics, streaming)
- Single task per host workloads
- Applications where network simplicity outweighs isolation needs

**Limitations:**
- No network isolation between containers and host (security risk)
- Port conflicts prevent multiple task instances per host
- Security groups apply to entire EC2 instance
- Less secure due to shared network stack

**Example Task Definition:**
```json
{
  "family": "high-performance-app",
  "networkMode": "host",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "streaming-app",
      "image": "my-streaming-app:latest",
      "memory": 1024,
      "cpu": 512
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. awsvpc Network Mode (Recommended for Production)

**What it does**: Each ECS task gets its own **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** with a private IP address in the VPC, providing the same networking capabilities as an EC2 instance.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Each task gets dedicated ENI with private IP
- **Security groups at task level** (fine-grained control)
- Compatible with **VPC Flow Logs** for traffic monitoring
- Containers in same task communicate via **localhost**
- Requires **NetworkConfiguration** (subnets, security groups)
- **Required for Fargate launch type**
- **[📖 awsvpc Mode Details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking-awsvpc.html)**

**Use Cases:**
- **Production microservices** (recommended for most workloads)
- Applications requiring strong network isolation and security
- Workloads needing task-specific security groups (least privilege)
- Compliance-driven environments requiring network monitoring
- Applications integrating with VPC features (private subnets, route tables)
- **Fargate deployments** (mandatory)

**Security Benefits:**
- **Granular security**: Task-level security groups enable fine-grained traffic control
- **Network monitoring**: Dedicated ENI supports VPC Flow Logs for compliance
- **IAM roles for tasks**: Avoid passing credentials; use temporary credentials
- **Isolation**: Each task in own network namespace

**Limitations:**
- Slightly higher operational complexity (VPC configuration required)
- Consumes ENIs (consider VPC ENI limits for large deployments)
- Not ideal for extremely lightweight workloads

**Example Task Definition:**
```json
{
  "family": "microservice-app",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
  "cpu": "256",
  "memory": "512",
  "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
  "taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/ecsTaskRole",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "api-service",
      "image": "my-api:latest",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 3000,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/api-service",
          "awslogs-region": "us-east-1",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Service with NetworkConfiguration:**
```bash
aws ecs create-service \
  --cluster production-cluster \
  --service-name api-service \
  --task-definition microservice-app:1 \
  --desired-count 3 \
  --launch-type FARGATE \
  --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={
    subnets=[subnet-12345,subnet-67890],
    securityGroups=[sg-api-service],
    assignPublicIp=DISABLED
  }" \
  --load-balancers "targetGroupArn=arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:...,containerName=api-service,containerPort=3000"
```

#### Exam Scenario: CRM Portal Security

**Scenario**: Company deploying customer-facing CRM portal with strict security requirements. Needs container-level security groups, network monitoring, and secure AWS resource access.

**Why awsvpc is correct:**
1. **Task-level security groups**: Apply least privilege at container level
2. **VPC Flow Logs**: Monitor traffic for compliance
3. **IAM roles for tasks**: Secure AWS resource access without hardcoded credentials
4. **Network isolation**: Each task in own network namespace

**Why other modes are incorrect:**
- **None**: No external connectivity (CRM needs internet access)
- **Bridge**: Security groups at instance level (insufficient granularity)
- **Host**: No task isolation, port conflicts, instance-level security
- **Passing IAM credentials**: Security risk (credentials in logs, misconfiguration)

**Best Practice**: Use **awsvpc + IAM roles for tasks** for secure, production microservices.

### Best Practices
