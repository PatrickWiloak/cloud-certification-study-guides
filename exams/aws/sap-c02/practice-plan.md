## 🎯 Exam Day Strategy

### Time Management (180 minutes, 75 questions)
- **Average time per question:** 2.4 minutes
- **First pass:** 90-120 minutes (flag difficult questions)
- **Second pass:** 45-60 minutes (review flagged questions)
- **Final review:** 15-30 minutes (check marked for review)

### Question Approach
1. **Read carefully** - Scenario-based questions can be long
2. **Identify key requirements** - Look for constraints (cost, performance, compliance)
3. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Usually 1-2 are obviously incorrect
4. **Choose best answer** - Not just "correct" but "most correct" for the scenario
5. **Flag and move on** - Don't spend >5 minutes on any question

### Common Traps
- ❌ Over-engineering solutions (choose simplest that meets requirements)
- ❌ Missing keyword constraints ("minimize cost", "highest availability", "compliance")
- ❌ Confusing similar services (FSx variants, Kinesis variants, etc.)
- ❌ Not considering multi-account/multi-region implications
- ❌ Forgetting migration/modernization best practices
