## Security Architecture Patterns

### Defense in Depth
```
Layer 1: AWS Account Security (Root account MFA, Organizations SCPs)
Layer 2: Network Security (VPC, Security Groups, NACLs, Network Firewall)
Layer 3: Application Security (WAF, API Gateway, CloudFront)
Layer 4: Data Security (Encryption at rest and in transit, KMS)
Layer 5: Identity Security (IAM, MFA, least privilege, federation)
Layer 6: Detection (GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail, Security Hub)
Layer 7: Response (Automated remediation, Incident Manager, runbooks)
```

### Zero Trust Architecture
- No implicit trust, verify everything
- Least privilege access (IAM policies, SCPs)
- Micro-segmentation (Security Groups per resource)
- Continuous monitoring (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty)
- Assume breach mentality (Detective for investigation)

### Incident Response Workflow
```
1. Detection → GuardDuty finding
2. Alert → EventBridge rule → SNS → Security team
3. Containment → Lambda function → Isolate instance (modify SG, attach forensic SG)
4. Investigation → Detective, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs
5. Eradication → Terminate compromised resources, patch vulnerabilities
6. Recovery → Restore from clean backups
7. Lessons Learned → Update runbooks, improve detections
```

## Common Security Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Detect and Remediate Exposed S3 Buckets
**Solution:**
- Config rule: `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`
- Config remediation action: SSM Automation runbook
- Lambda function: Remove public access policies
- Security Hub: Aggregate findings
- EventBridge: Trigger on Config non-compliance
- SNS: Notify security team

### Scenario 2: Encrypt All EBS Volumes
**Solution:**
- Enable EBS encryption by default (per region)
- Config rule: `ec2-ebs-encryption-by-default`
- Existing unencrypted volumes: Snapshot → Copy with encryption → Create new volume
- AWS Backup: Enforce encryption in backup vault
- SCP: Deny ec2:RunInstances without encrypted volumes

### Scenario 3: Centralized Logging for 100+ Accounts
**Solution:**
- Organizations: Central security account
- CloudTrail: Organization trail → S3 in security account
- Config: Aggregator in security account
- GuardDuty: Delegated administrator in security account
- Security Hub: Delegated administrator with cross-region aggregation
- S3 bucket: Server-side encryption with KMS, versioning, MFA delete, lifecycle policy

### Scenario 4: Prevent Data Exfiltration
**Solution:**
- VPC endpoints for S3, DynamoDB (no internet gateway)
- S3 bucket policies: Enforce aws:SourceVpc or aws:SourceVpce
- SCPs: Deny s3:PutObject without encryption
- GuardDuty: Detect unusual data transfer patterns
- Macie: Identify sensitive data in S3
- VPC Flow Logs: Monitor network traffic
- CloudTrail: Audit all S3 API calls

### Scenario 5: Compromised IAM Credentials
**Response:**
1. Immediately disable credentials (make inactive or delete)
2. Review CloudTrail for unauthorized actions
3. Revoke active sessions (AWS STS)
4. Rotate all other credentials
5. Review and remove unauthorized resources
6. Enable GuardDuty if not already enabled
7. Implement stricter IAM policies and MFA

## Key Security Limits & Numbers

**IAM:**
- 5,000 users per account (soft limit)
- 300 groups per account (soft limit)
- 1,500 roles per account (soft limit)
- 10 managed policies per user/group/role
- 2,048 characters max policy size (identity-based)
- 10,240 characters max policy size (resource-based)

**KMS:**
- 100,000 CMKs per region (soft limit)
- 10,000 grants per CMK (soft limit)
- 10 KB max encrypted data via KMS API directly
- Automatic key rotation: Once per year

**GuardDuty:**
- 10,000 trusted IP lists per account
- 1,000 threat lists per account
- 6 MB max threat list file size

**Security Hub:**
- 100 finding aggregators per region
- 3,000 insights per account per region
- 100,000 findings per account per region

**CloudTrail:**
- 5 trails per region (organizational trail counts as 1)
- 90 days event history (free, no S3)
- Unlimited retention with S3 storage

## Exam Strategy

### Time Management
- 170 minutes ÷ 65 questions = 2.6 minutes per question
- Security scenarios can be complex
- Flag difficult questions, return later

### Question Keywords
- **"Most secure"** → Defense in depth, least privilege, MFA, encryption
- **"Detect"** → GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs
- **"Prevent"** → SCPs, IAM policies, Security Groups, WAF
- **"Audit"** → CloudTrail, Config, Access Analyzer, Security Hub
- **"Encrypt"** → KMS, CloudHSM, SSL/TLS, enforce via policies
- **"Compliance"** → Config rules, Audit Manager, Security Hub standards
- **"Least privilege"** → IAM policies, SCPs, permission boundaries

### Common Traps
- ❌ Root account usage (almost never correct)
- ❌ Security through obscurity
- ❌ Overly permissive policies (should be least privilege)
- ❌ Not enabling encryption by default
- ❌ Ignoring logging and monitoring
