**Solution**:
- **AWS Organizations** - OU structure (prod, dev, shared services)
- **Transit Gateway** - Centralized hub in network account
- **RAM (Resource Access Manager)** - Share TGW with all accounts
- **[📖 RAM for Transit Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-ram.html)** - Cross-account sharing
- **Firewall Manager** - Enforce WAF, Shield, Network Firewall policies
- **VPC Flow Logs** - Centralized logging to S3 in security account

### Scenario 4: Direct Connect Redundancy
**Problem**: Mission-critical on-premises to AWS connectivity, need 99.99% SLA
**Solution**:
- **2 Direct Connect connections** - Separate DX locations
- **[📖 DX Resiliency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/resiliency_toolkit.html)** - Maximum resiliency
- **2 VPN connections** - Backup over internet
- **BGP** - Active-active or active-passive routing
- **Transit Gateway** - Single attachment point, handles failover

### Scenario 5: VPC CIDR Exhaustion
**Problem**: VPC 10.0.0.0/16 is full, need more IPs
**Solution**:
- **Add secondary CIDR** - 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16 (up to 5 secondary)
- **[📖 Add CIDR to VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-your-vpc.html#add-cidr-block-restrictions)** - No downtime
- **Update route tables** - Add routes for new CIDR
- **Create new subnets** - In secondary CIDR blocks
- **Note**: Cannot remove primary CIDR, can remove secondary

### Scenario 6: PrivateLink for SaaS Multi-Tenant
**Problem**: Provide SaaS to customers without exposing to internet
**Solution**:
- **Network Load Balancer** - Front-end for service
- **VPC Endpoint Service** - Powered by PrivateLink
- **[📖 VPC Endpoint Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/endpoint-service.html)** - Service provider
- **Customers create interface endpoints** - In their VPCs, connect to your service
- **Acceptance required** - Whitelist customer accounts/principals

### Scenario 7: Troubleshoot Connectivity Issue
**Problem**: EC2 in private subnet cannot reach S3
**Troubleshooting steps**:
1. **Route table** - Check for S3 gateway endpoint or NAT Gateway route
2. **Security group** - Outbound HTTPS (443) allowed?
3. **NACL** - Stateless, both directions allowed?
4. **S3 bucket policy** - VPC endpoint policy restricting access?
5. **VPC Flow Logs** - Check for REJECT entries
6. **Reachability Analyzer** - Run path analysis from instance to S3
7. **[📖 Troubleshooting VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html)**

### Scenario 8: Optimize Data Transfer Costs
**Problem**: High NAT Gateway charges for S3 uploads
**Solution**:
- **S3 Gateway Endpoint** - Free, no NAT Gateway charges
- **[📖 Gateway Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.html)** - Private S3 access
- **Interface endpoint** - For other services (SNS, SQS, etc.)
- **DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint** - Free DynamoDB access from VPC

## Exam Tips

### Key Topics to Master
1. **VPC connectivity patterns** - Peering, Transit Gateway, PrivateLink
2. **Hybrid connectivity** - Direct Connect, VPN, DX Gateway
3. **Routing** - Route tables, BGP, route propagation, longest prefix match
4. **Security** - Security groups, NACLs, WAF, Shield, Network Firewall
5. **Load balancing** - ALB vs NLB vs GWLB decision tree
6. **DNS** - Route 53 routing policies, private hosted zones, Resolver
7. **Monitoring** - VPC Flow Logs, Reachability Analyzer, Traffic Mirroring
8. **Cost optimization** - VPC endpoints, NAT Gateway vs NAT instance, data transfer

### Common Pitfalls
- **Transitive routing** - VPC peering is NOT transitive, use Transit Gateway
- **Security groups vs NACLs** - SG is stateful, NACL is stateless
- **NAT Gateway limitations** - Only IPv4, only outbound internet
- **Direct Connect latency** - Lower latency than VPN, but NOT zero latency
- **VPC endpoint** - Gateway (S3/DynamoDB) is free, interface endpoints cost money
- **CIDR overlap** - Cannot peer or connect VPCs with overlapping CIDRs

### BGP and Routing Deep Dive
- **BGP ASN** - AWS uses ASN 64512 for VGW, customer uses private ASN (64512-65534)
- **Route propagation** - VGW propagates on-premises routes to route tables
- **Longest prefix match** - More specific route wins (10.0.1.0/24 beats 10.0.0.0/16)
- **Local route priority** - Local route always wins over propagated routes
- **AS_PATH** - Prefer shorter AS path (BGP path selection)
- **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)** - Influence inbound traffic from AWS to on-premises

### Direct Connect vs VPN Decision Matrix
| Requirement | Direct Connect | VPN |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Low latency | ✅ | ❌ |
| High bandwidth (>10 Gbps) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Encrypted by default | ❌ | ✅ |
| Quick setup | ❌ (weeks) | ✅ (minutes) |
| Cost-effective for low traffic | ❌ | ✅ |
| SLA | ✅ (with redundancy) | ❌ |
| Private connectivity | ✅ | ❌ (over internet) |

### Load Balancer Selection
| Use Case | Load Balancer |
|----------|---------------|
| HTTP/HTTPS, content routing | ALB |
| Static IP required | NLB |
| Preserve source IP | NLB |
| Ultra-low latency | NLB |
| PrivateLink | NLB |
| Inline security appliances | GWLB |
| TCP/UDP (non-HTTP) | NLB |
| WebSocket | ALB or NLB |
| gRPC | ALB |
