## IAM Advanced Concepts

### Policy Types & Evaluation

**[📖 IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)**

**Policy Types:**
1. **Identity-based** - Attached to users, groups, roles
2. **Resource-based** - Attached to resources (S3, SQS, Lambda, etc.)
3. **Permissions boundaries** - Max permissions for identity policies
4. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** - Organizational-level guardrails
5. **Session policies** - Passed during AssumeRole
6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - Legacy (S3, VPC)
- **[📖 Policy Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policy-types)** - Detailed comparison

**Evaluation Logic:**
1. By default, **explicit DENY**
2. Evaluate all policies (identity, resource, SCPs, boundaries, session)
3. **Explicit DENY** always wins
4. If any **explicit ALLOW** (and no deny), allow
5. Otherwise, implicit deny
- **[📖 Policy Evaluation Logic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html)** - Complete evaluation flow

### Cross-Account Access Patterns

**Pattern 1: IAM Roles (Preferred)**
```
Account A → AssumeRole → Role in Account B → Access resources
```
- Most secure
- Temporary credentials
- MFA support
- CloudTrail logging

**Pattern 2: Resource-Based Policies**
```
S3 bucket in Account B → Bucket policy allows Account A principal
```
- Direct access
- No AssumeRole needed
- Limited to services supporting resource policies

**Pattern 3: AWS Organizations + RAM**
```
Share resources via RAM → Access in member accounts
```
- Centralized sharing
- Transit Gateway, Subnets, License Manager, etc.

## Database Selection Decision Tree

```
Relational needed?
├─ YES → ACID required?
│  ├─ YES → Multi-region active-active?
│  │  ├─ YES → Aurora Global Database
│  │  └─ NO → Aurora Regional
│  └─ NO → Read-heavy workload?
│     ├─ YES → Aurora with Read Replicas
│     └─ NO → RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)
└─ NO → Data model?
   ├─ Key-Value/Document → DynamoDB
   ├─ Wide-Column → Keyspaces (Cassandra)
   ├─ Graph → Neptune
   ├─ Time-Series → Timestream
   ├─ Ledger/Immutable → QLDB
   └─ Document (MongoDB) → DocumentDB
```

## High Availability Patterns

### Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region

**Multi-AZ (Regional HA):**
- Protects against AZ failures
- Synchronous replication (RDS, Aurora)
- Automatic failover (< 60 seconds RDS, < 30 sec Aurora)
- Same region latency (milliseconds)
- **RTO:** Minutes | **RPO:** Zero (sync replication)

**Multi-Region (Geographic HA + DR):**
- Protects against region failures
- Asynchronous replication
- Manual or automated failover
- Cross-region latency (varies by distance)
- **RTO:** Minutes to hours | **RPO:** Seconds to minutes

### Disaster Recovery Strategies

| Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost | Complexity |
|----------|-----|-----|------|------------|
| **Backup & Restore** | Hours-Days | Hours | $ | Low |
| **Pilot Light** | 10s of minutes | Minutes | $$ | Medium |
| **Warm Standby** | Minutes | Seconds | $$$ | Medium-High |
| **Active-Active Multi-Region** | Seconds | Near-Zero | $$$$ | High |

**Backup & Restore:**
- Periodic backups to S3
- Restore when needed
- Cheapest, longest RTO/RPO

**Pilot Light:**
- Core systems running minimal resources
- Scale up during disaster
- Data replication active (DRS, DMS, S3 CRR)

**Warm Standby:**
- Scaled-down fully functional environment
- Scale up during disaster
- Continuous data replication

**Active-Active:**
- Full production in multiple regions
- Users served from nearest region
- Instant failover (Route 53, Global Accelerator)
- Highest cost, best RTO/RPO

## Caching Strategies

### Multi-Layer Caching

```
User Request
  ↓
CloudFront (Edge Cache - seconds to minutes)
  ↓
API Gateway (Endpoint Cache - seconds to hours)
  ↓
Application (ElastiCache/DAX - milliseconds to seconds)
  ↓
Database (Query Cache - milliseconds)
```

### When to Use Each

**CloudFront:**

**EventBridge vs SNS vs SQS:**

| Feature | EventBridge | SNS | SQS |
|---------|-------------|-----|-----|
| **Pattern** | Event bus | Pub/sub | Queue |
| **Filtering** | Advanced (JSON patterns) | Basic (attributes) | None (consumer-side) |
| **Targets** | 100+ AWS services | Limited protocols | Pull-based consumers |
| **SaaS** | 40+ integrations | None | None |
| **Schema** | Schema registry | No | No |
| **Replay** | Archive & replay | No | Dead-letter queue |
| **Use case** | Complex event routing | Fan-out notifications | Decoupling, buffering |

### Step Functions Workflow Types

**Standard Workflows:**
- Duration: Up to 1 year
- Execution rate: 2,000/second
- Pricing: Per state transition
- Exactly-once execution
- Use for: Long-running, human approvals, audit

**Express Workflows:**
- Duration: Up to 5 minutes
- Execution rate: 100,000/second
- Pricing: Per execution duration
- At-least-once execution
- Use for: High-volume event processing, IoT, streaming

**Saga Pattern with Step Functions:**
```
Try Operation 1 → Success → Try Operation 2 → Success → Complete
     ↓                            ↓
   Fail                         Fail
     ↓                            ↓
Compensate 1                 Compensate 2 → Compensate 1
```

## Key Numbers to Memorize

**Service Limits:**
- Lambda: 15 min timeout, 10 GB memory, 250 MB deployment (unzipped)
- API Gateway: 29 sec timeout, 10 MB payload
- Step Functions Standard: 1 year max duration
- Step Functions Express: 5 min max duration
- Direct Connect: 1, 10, 100 Gbps dedicated
- Transit Gateway: 5,000 VPC attachments, 50 Gbps per AZ
- VPC Peering: 125 per VPC
- Aurora Global: < 1 sec cross-region latency, 5 secondary regions max
- DynamoDB: 400 KB item size, 25 items per batch

**Timing:**
- RDS Multi-AZ failover: < 60 seconds
- Aurora Multi-AZ failover: < 30 seconds
- S3 eventual consistency: < 1 second (now strong consistency for all ops)
- CloudFront edge locations: 450+
- Regions: 32+, AZs: 100+

## Exam Strategy

### Time Management
- 180 minutes ÷ 75 questions = 2.4 minutes per question
- Scenarios are LONG (1-2 paragraphs)
- First pass: Answer known questions (90 minutes)
- Second pass: Tackle flagged questions (70 minutes)
- Final pass: Review all answers (20 minutes)

### Question Analysis
1. **Read the entire scenario** - Don't skim
2. **Identify the actual question** - Often at the end
3. **Note constraints** - Cost, time, complexity, region, compliance
4. **Eliminate obviously wrong** - Usually 2 options are clearly wrong
5. **Compare remaining options** - Trade-offs between final 2
6. **Choose the BEST** - Not just correct, but most appropriate

### Keywords to Watch
- **"Most cost-effective"** → Savings Plans, Spot, S3 tiers, Savings Plans
- **"Least operational overhead"** → Managed services, serverless, automation
- **"High availability"** → Multi-AZ, Multi-Region, Auto Scaling
- **"Disaster recovery"** → Backup strategy, multi-region, automated failover
- **"Security"** → Least privilege, encryption, isolation, audit logging
- **"Performance"** → Caching, CDN, Global Accelerator, optimized services
- **"Large-scale"** → Organizations, Transit Gateway, automation
- **"Hybrid"** → Direct Connect, Storage Gateway, Route 53 Resolver

### Common Traps
- ❌ Choosing theoretical "best" over practical "most appropriate"
- ❌ Over-engineering simple requirements
- ❌ Ignoring constraints (budget, time, skills)
- ❌ Mixing up service capabilities (timeouts, limits)
- ❌ Not considering operational overhead
- ❌ Forgetting about existing AWS footprint

**Pro Tip:** SAP-C02 tests your ability to make architectural trade-offs. There are often multiple "correct" answers - you need to choose the "most appropriate" considering all constraints (cost, time, complexity, operational overhead). Always justify your choice with specific trade-offs!

**Good luck!** This is the hardest AWS certification, but passing it demonstrates expert-level cloud architecture skills. 🚀
