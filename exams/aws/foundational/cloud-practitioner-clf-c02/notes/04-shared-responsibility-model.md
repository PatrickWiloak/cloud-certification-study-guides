# AWS Shared Responsibility Model

## Overview

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model is a security and compliance framework that delineates the security responsibilities of AWS versus those of the customer. This model helps relieve customer's operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities.

## Core Concept

### "Security OF the Cloud" vs "Security IN the Cloud"

- **AWS Responsibility**: "Security OF the Cloud"
  - Physical infrastructure
  - Global infrastructure
  - Hardware and software that runs AWS services

- **Customer Responsibility**: "Security IN the Cloud"
  - Customer data
  - Platform, applications, and identity & access management
  - Operating system, network, and firewall configuration

## AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud)

### Physical and Environmental Security
- **Data Centers**: Physical access control and security
- **Hardware**: Server hardware and networking equipment
- **Environmental Controls**: Power, cooling, and fire suppression
- **Physical Disposal**: Secure hardware disposal and destruction

### Infrastructure Security
- **Global Infrastructure**: Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations
- **Compute Infrastructure**: Physical servers and hypervisors
- **Storage Infrastructure**: Physical storage systems
- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, load balancers

### Service Security
- **Managed Services**: Security of the service itself
- **API Endpoints**: Security of AWS API endpoints

## Security Controls by Service Type

### Compute Services

#### EC2 (Virtual Machines)

- **Customer**: Function code, data processing, access controls

#### ECS/EKS (Containers)
- **AWS**: Host OS, container service, API endpoints
- **Customer**: Container images, application security, task definitions

### Storage Services

#### S3 (Object Storage)
- **AWS**: Storage infrastructure, durability, availability, service features
- **Customer**: Data encryption, bucket policies, access controls, data classification

#### EBS (Block Storage)
- **AWS**: Storage infrastructure, replication within AZ, snapshot encryption
- **Customer**: Data on volumes, encryption configuration, access management

#### EFS (File System)
- **AWS**: File system infrastructure, availability, backup service
- **Customer**: Data stored, encryption settings, access points, file permissions

### Database Services

#### RDS (Managed Database)
- **AWS**: DB software, OS patching, hardware, automated backups
- **Customer**: Database user management, data, network access, parameter groups

#### DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)

### Network Services

#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **Customer**: VPC configuration, subnets, routing tables, security groups

#### CloudFront (CDN)

- **Customer**: Content, access controls, origin security, SSL certificates

## Compliance Considerations

### Shared Compliance Responsibilities
- **AWS**: Infrastructure compliance (SOC, PCI, HIPAA eligible)
- **Customer**: Application and data compliance
- **Both**: Ongoing monitoring and incident response

### Compliance Programs
- **AWS Compliance**: Infrastructure meets various standards
- **Customer Compliance**: Applications must be configured compliantly
- **Audit Requirements**: Customers may need to audit their implementations

## Best Practices for Customers

### Security Implementation
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep systems and applications updated
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. **Access Controls**: Implement strong access management
3. **Backup**: Regular backups with tested restoration procedures
4. **Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity

### Network Security
1. **Security Groups**: Configure restrictive security group rules
2. **Network Segmentation**: Use subnets to segment workloads
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic and access patterns
4. **VPN/Direct Connect**: Secure connectivity for hybrid architectures

### Identity and Access Management
1. **IAM Policies**: Use managed policies where possible
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA for all users
3. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and audit access permissions
4. **Service Accounts**: Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys

## Common Misconceptions

### AWS is Responsible for Everything
- **Reality**: Customers have significant security responsibilities
- **Implication**: Customers must actively configure and manage security

### Customer Data is Automatically Encrypted
- **Reality**: Encryption must be explicitly configured
- **Implication**: Customers must choose and configure encryption options

### AWS Manages All Updates
- **Reality**: Customer applications and OS updates are customer responsibility
- **Implication**: Customers must maintain patching schedules

### Security Groups are Automatically Configured
- **Reality**: Customers must configure appropriate rules
- **Implication**: Default rules may be too permissive

## Tools for Managing Responsibilities

### AWS Tools

- **AWS CloudTrail**: API call logging and monitoring
- **AWS Security Hub**: Centralized security findings
- **AWS Inspector**: Application security assessment
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Threat detection service

### Customer Tools
