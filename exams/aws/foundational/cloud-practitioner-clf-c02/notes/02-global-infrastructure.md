# AWS Global Infrastructure

## Overview

AWS Global Infrastructure is designed to deliver a consistent, reliable, and secure cloud computing environment with the highest levels of availability. It consists of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, Edge Locations, and specialized infrastructure components.

## AWS Regions

### Definition
A Region is a physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers. Each Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones within a geographic area.

### Key Characteristics
- **Geographic Separation**: Regions are geographically distributed globally
- **Isolated**: Each Region is completely isolated from other Regions
- **Independent**: Regions operate independently for fault tolerance
- **Data Sovereignty**: Data remains in the Region unless explicitly moved

### Current Global Presence (2024/2025)
- **33+ Regions** worldwide
- **105+ Availability Zones**
- **600+ Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches**
- Presence in **190+ countries**

### Major Regions Include
- **US East (N. Virginia)** - us-east-1 (First AWS Region)
- **US West (Oregon)** - us-west-2
- **Europe (Ireland)** - eu-west-1
- **Asia Pacific (Singapore)** - ap-southeast-1
- **South America (SÃ£o Paulo)** - sa-east-1

### How to Choose a Region

#### 1. Compliance and Legal Requirements
- Data sovereignty laws
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Government regulations
- Industry-specific requirements

#### 2. Proximity to Users (Latency)
- Distance affects latency
- Choose Region closest to main user base
- Consider global user distribution
- Test latency from different locations

#### 3. Available Services
- Not all services available in all Regions
- New services typically launch in us-east-1 first
- Check service availability before choosing
- Consider future service needs

#### 4. Pricing
- Pricing varies by Region
- Some Regions more expensive due to local costs
- Consider data transfer costs
- Factor in currency exchange rates

## Availability Zones (AZs)

### Definition
An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs are isolated from each other to provide fault tolerance.

### Key Characteristics
- **Physical Separation**: Separated by meaningful distances (miles/kilometers)
- **Independent Infrastructure**: Own power, cooling, and networking
- **High-speed Connectivity**: Connected via high-bandwidth, low-latency links
- **Fault Isolation**: Designed to isolate failures
- **Redundancy**: Multiple AZs per Region for resilience

### Naming Convention
- Format: Region code + letter (e.g., us-east-1a, us-east-1b)
- Letters randomized per AWS account for load distribution
- Each account sees different physical AZ for same letter

### Best Practices
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Deploy across multiple AZs for high availability
- **Load Distribution**: Distribute resources evenly across AZs
- **Data Replication**: Replicate critical data across AZs
- **Disaster Recovery**: Use multiple AZs for business continuity

## Edge Locations and CloudFront

### Edge Locations
- **Definition**: Data centers used by CloudFront for content delivery
- **Purpose**: Cache content closer to end users
- **Global Distribution**: 600+ locations worldwide
- **Reduced Latency**: Deliver content from nearest location

### Regional Edge Caches
- **Larger Caches**: Between CloudFront Edge Locations and origin
- **Improved Performance**: Cache less popular content
- **Cost Effective**: Reduce origin requests

## AWS Wavelength

### Definition
AWS Wavelength brings AWS services to the edge of 5G networks, enabling ultra-low latency applications.

### Key Features
- **5G Integration**: Embedded within telecommunications providers' networks
- **Ultra-low Latency**: Sub-10 millisecond latency
