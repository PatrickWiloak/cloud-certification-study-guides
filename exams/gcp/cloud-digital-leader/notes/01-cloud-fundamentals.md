# Cloud Fundamentals

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Google Cloud.

**Business Definition:** Cloud computing enables organizations to consume computing resources (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) as a utility service, similar to electricity or water, rather than building and maintaining their own infrastructure.

### Key Characteristics (NIST Definition)

These five characteristics define true cloud computing and represent the business value proposition:

- **On-demand self-service:** Business users can provision resources automatically without IT tickets or human interaction
  - *Business Impact:* Reduces time-to-market from weeks to minutes
  - *Example:* Marketing team launches new campaign website in 30 minutes instead of waiting 2 weeks for IT provisioning

- **Broad network access:** Available over the network via standard mechanisms from any device
  - *Business Impact:* Enables remote work and global collaboration
  - *Example:* Sales team accesses CRM from mobile devices while traveling worldwide

- **Resource pooling:** Provider resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using multi-tenant model
  - *Business Impact:* Lower costs through economies of scale
  - *Example:* Small business gets enterprise-grade infrastructure at fraction of the cost

- **Rapid elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale with demand
  - *Business Impact:* Handle seasonal peaks without over-provisioning for entire year
  - *Example:* Retail website scales automatically during Black Friday, then scales down afterward

- **Measured service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by metering
  - *Business Impact:* Pay only for what you use, improve cost predictability and optimization
  - *Example:* CFO can view real-time cloud spending by department and project

- Analysis shows 8-core, 32GB instances sufficient (actual usage: 15% CPU, 20% RAM)
- Cost reduction: 70% savings = $30K/month → $9K/month
- Action: Implement monitoring, right-size quarterly

#### 2. Committed Use Discounts / Reserved Instances
**Strategy:** Commit to 1 or 3-year usage for predictable workloads.

**Business Scenario:**
- Web application with steady baseline traffic
- Baseline: 20 instances running 24/7
- On-demand cost: $10K/month
- 1-year commitment: $7K/month (30% savings = $36K/year)
- 3-year commitment: $5K/month (50% savings = $60K/year)
- **Decision criteria:** Commit when workload expected to run 12+ months

#### 3. Auto-Scaling and Scheduling
**Strategy:** Automatically scale resources based on demand, turn off non-production resources.

**Business Impact Example:**
- Development/test environments used only business hours (50 hours/week vs. 168)
- Previous: 30 instances × 24/7 × $1/hour = $21,600/month
- Optimized: Automatically shut down nights/weekends
- New cost: 30 instances × 50 hours/week × $1/hour = $6,000/month
- Savings: $15,600/month (72% reduction) with zero functionality impact

#### 4. Storage Tiering
**Strategy:** Move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage classes.

**Storage Class Economics (Google Cloud Storage example):**
- **Standard:** $0.020/GB/month - frequent access, millisecond latency
- **Nearline:** $0.010/GB/month - access once per month, good for backups
- **Coldline:** $0.004/GB/month - access once per quarter, good for archives
- **Archive:** $0.0012/GB/month - access once per year, regulatory retention

**Business Scenario - Media Company:**
- 500TB video archive
- Costs if all Standard: 500TB × $20/TB = $10K/month
- Optimized tiering:
  - 50TB Standard (recent/popular): $1K/month
  - 150TB Nearline (last year): $1.5K/month
  - 300TB Archive (older content): $360/month
- **Total optimized: $2,860/month (71% savings = $86K/year)**

#### 5. Monitoring and Cost Governance
**Strategy:** Implement visibility, budgets, alerts, and accountability.

**Cost Management Best Practices:**
- **Tagging/Labeling:** Tag all resources by department, project, environment (production, dev, test)
- **Budget Alerts:** Set up alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of budget thresholds
- **Regular Reviews:** Monthly cost reviews with stakeholders
- **Showback/Chargeback:** Show departments their cloud costs to drive accountability
- **FinOps Culture:** Shared responsibility for cost optimization

**Business Impact:**
- Company implemented tagging and discovered:
  - 30% of costs were forgotten test projects
  - One department's experiment running for 8 months = $50K waste
  - Terminated unused resources = $200K annual savings

## Cloud Migration Strategies

### The 6 R's of Cloud Migration

Migration strategy selection is a critical business decision that impacts timeline, cost, risk, and ultimate cloud benefits.

#### 1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)
**Definition:** Move applications to cloud with minimal or no changes.

**Business Rationale:**
- Fastest migration path (weeks to months)
- Lowest migration risk and complexity
- Immediate infrastructure cost savings
- Defer optimization to later phases
- Meet urgent deadlines (data center closure, contract expiration)

**When to Use:**
- Data center lease expiring soon
- Large number of applications to migrate quickly
- Limited cloud expertise on team
- Need to demonstrate quick wins
- Applications work well as-is

**Business Example - Manufacturing Company:**
- **Situation:** Data center closing in 9 months, 200 applications to migrate
- **Approach:** Lift-and-shift 180 applications, focus modernization on 20 critical apps
- **Timeline:** Migrated 180 apps in 6 months
- **Results:** $2M annual infrastructure savings, met deadline, avoided $5M data center renewal
- **Next Steps:** Modernizing applications incrementally over 2 years

**Cost Impact:**
- Migration cost: Low (automated tools available)
- Short-term cloud costs: May be 10-20% higher than optimized (not using cloud-native features)
- Long-term optimization: Can reduce costs 30-50% through later optimization

#### 2. Replatform (Lift and Optimize)
**Definition:** Make some cloud optimizations without changing core architecture.

**Common Optimizations:**
- Migrate database to managed service (Cloud SQL instead of self-managed)
- Use cloud load balancers instead of software load balancers
- Adopt cloud storage instead of file servers
- Use managed caching services

**Business Rationale:**
- Balance speed and benefits (3-6 months per application)
- Reduce operational overhead through managed services
- Immediate cost savings plus some cloud benefits
- Lower risk than full re-architecture

**When to Use:**
- Applications can benefit from managed services
- Want to reduce operational burden
- Have time for some optimization
- Database licensing costs are high

**Business Example - Healthcare Provider:**
- **Application:** Patient records system with Oracle database
- **Approach:** Replatformed application to cloud, migrated to Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Timeline:** 4 months (vs. 2 months lift-and-shift, 12+ months refactor)
- **Results:**
  - Eliminated $200K/year Oracle licenses
  - Reduced DBA workload by 70% (automated backups, patches, scaling)
  - Improved reliability (99.95% SLA vs. 99% on-premises)
- **ROI:** $250K annual savings, payback in 8 months

#### 3. Refactor (Re-architect)
**Definition:** Significantly modify application to leverage cloud-native features.

**Cloud-Native Features:**
- Microservices architecture instead of monolith
- Serverless computing (functions, managed containers)
- Auto-scaling and elastic load balancing
- Managed NoSQL databases
- Event-driven architecture
- API-first design

**Business Rationale:**
- Maximum cloud benefits (scalability, resilience, cost optimization)
- Modern architecture for agility
- Better performance and user experience
- Competitive advantage
- Higher investment but better long-term ROI

**When to Use:**
- Strategic, customer-facing applications
- Applications requiring significant scalability
- Existing architecture has limitations
- Greenfield or new features planned
- Have development resources and time

**Business Example - E-commerce Retailer:**
- **Application:** Monolithic shopping cart application struggling with scale
- **Approach:** Re-architected to microservices, serverless functions, auto-scaling
- **Timeline:** 12 months, phased migration
- **Investment:** $1.5M (development, testing, migration)
- **Results:**
  - Handled 10x Black Friday traffic without outages (previous years: frequent crashes)
  - Reduced infrastructure costs 40% through auto-scaling
  - Deploy new features 5x faster (microservices independence)
  - Revenue impact: Captured $2M additional Black Friday sales (no downtime)
- **ROI:** Positive within 18 months through increased revenue and cost savings

#### 4. Repurchase (Replace with SaaS)
**Definition:** Replace existing application with commercial SaaS product.

**Common Repurchase Scenarios:**
- Email: Exchange → Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
- CRM: Custom or legacy → Salesforce
- HR: On-premises → Workday
- Collaboration: File servers → Google Drive, Box
- ERP: Legacy on-premises → Cloud ERP

**Business Rationale:**
- Fastest time to value (days to weeks)
- Zero infrastructure management
- Always current features
- Predictable per-user pricing
- Industry best practices built-in
- Lower total cost of ownership

**When to Use:**
- Commodity business functions (email, collaboration, HR, CRM)
- Custom application provides little competitive advantage
- Want to eliminate maintenance burden
- Standard functionality meets requirements
- Vendor has strong track record

**Business Example - Professional Services Firm:**
- **Situation:** Running on-premises email (Exchange) for 500 users
- **Approach:** Migrated to Google Workspace
- **Timeline:** 6 weeks (planning, migration, training)
- **Costs:**
  - On-premises: $150K/year (servers, licenses, 1 FTE admin, storage)
  - Google Workspace: $72K/year ($12/user/month)
  - Migration cost: $30K (consulting, training)
- **Results:**
  - Annual savings: $78K
  - Improved collaboration (Docs, Drive, Meet)
  - Enabled remote work during pandemic
  - Eliminated email outages
- **ROI:** Payback in 5 months

#### 5. Retire
**Definition:** Decommission applications no longer needed.

**Business Value:**
- Reduce cloud migration scope and cost
- Eliminate maintenance and licensing costs
- Simplify IT landscape
- Reduce security attack surface

**Discovery Process:**
- Inventory all applications
- Identify actual usage (often 10-20% of apps rarely used)
- Survey business stakeholders
- Assess data retention requirements

**Business Example - Financial Institution:**
- **Discovery:** Audited 300 applications before migration
- **Findings:** 60 applications used by fewer than 5 people, 30 not used in 12+ months
- **Action:** Retired 90 applications (30% reduction)
- **Benefits:**
  - Avoided migrating 90 applications ($500K migration savings)
  - Eliminated $200K annual licensing costs
  - Reduced attack surface and compliance scope
  - Simplified IT portfolio

#### 6. Retain (Revisit Later)
**Definition:** Keep on-premises for now, revisit in future.

**Reasons to Retain:**
- Application not ready for migration (dependencies)
- Regulatory or compliance constraints (temporary)
- End-of-life planned soon (retiring next year)
- Requires mainframe or specialized hardware
- Business case doesn't justify migration cost
- Risk too high, defer until learn from other migrations

**Strategic Approach:**
- Migrate most applications first
- Gain cloud experience and confidence
- Keep most difficult/risky applications for last
- Maintain hybrid connectivity

**Business Example - Insurance Company:**
- **Portfolio:** 150 applications to migrate
- **Approach:** Migrated 120 applications (rehost/replatform)
- **Retained 30 applications:**
  - 15 with complex dependencies (tackle after gaining experience)
  - 10 planned for retirement in 18-24 months (not worth migrating)
  - 5 under active redevelopment (will deploy new version to cloud)
- **Results:** Achieved 80% cloud migration, deferred high-risk applications, optimized investment

### Migration Business Considerations

#### Timeline and Resource Planning
**Factors Affecting Timeline:**
- Number of applications
- Application complexity
- Migration strategy mix (lift-and-shift faster than refactor)
- Team size and experience
- Downtime tolerance

**Typical Timeline Examples:**
- 50 applications, mostly lift-and-shift: 6-12 months
- 200 applications, mixed strategies: 18-24 months
- 10 strategic applications, full refactor: 12-18 months

#### Risk Management
**Common Migration Risks:**
- **Downtime:** Plan maintenance windows, use phased cutover
- **Performance:** Load test before cutover, have rollback plan
- **Data Loss:** Backup before migration, verify data integrity
- **Cost Overruns:** Start with pilot, monitor costs closely, set budgets
- **Skills Gap:** Train team, partner with consultants, hire cloud expertise

**Risk Mitigation Example:**
- Pilot with 3-5 non-critical applications first
- Learn lessons, refine process
- Document runbooks and automation
- Then tackle more critical applications

#### Business Continuity
**Ensuring Business Operations Continue:**
- Migrate outside business hours when possible
- Use phased cutover (gradual traffic shift)
- Maintain on-premises backup during transition
- Have rollback procedures ready
- Extensive testing before production cutover

### Total Migration Cost Components

**One-Time Migration Costs:**
- Migration tools and automation

  - For specific capabilities not available on primary
  - For geographic requirements
  - For disaster recovery

**Best Answer:** **Start with single cloud provider** - For regional bank new to cloud, single provider reduces complexity, builds expertise, faster time-to-value. Add multi-cloud selectively later for specific business needs, not as architectural goal.

### Scenario 5: Startup - Infrastructure Decisions

**Business Context:**
- Software startup with 20 employees
- Building SaaS product for small business customers
- $2M seed funding, 18-month runway
- CTO debating: build own infrastructure (IaaS) vs. use managed services (PaaS)
- Wants to keep costs low but scale quickly if product succeeds

**Business Question:** IaaS vs. PaaS - which approach for startup?

**Analysis:**
- **IaaS Approach:**
  - More control and flexibility
  - Requires infrastructure expertise
  - Team spends time managing servers, databases, networking
  - Lower per-unit costs if high volume

### Key Exam Strategies

#### 1. Think Like a Business Leader, Not a Technician
**What This Means:**
- Focus on "why" and "what business value" not "how to configure"
- Understand business trade-offs (cost vs. time, control vs. convenience, risk vs. reward)
- Think about ROI, TCO, time-to-market, competitive advantage
- Consider organizational and change management aspects

**Example Question Type:**
- "A retail company wants to reduce infrastructure costs while handling seasonal traffic spikes. What should they consider?"
  - **Technical answer:** "Use auto-scaling groups with load balancers"
  - **Business answer:** "Public cloud with auto-scaling to pay only for capacity when needed, reducing annual costs while handling peaks"
  - Exam wants the business rationale, not technical implementation

#### 2. Understand Decision Frameworks
**Key Decision Patterns:**

**IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS:**
- IaaS = maximum control, more management
- PaaS = balance, managed infrastructure
- SaaS = minimum management, least flexibility
- Choose based on: control requirements, expertise available, time-to-market needs

**Migration Strategy Selection:**
- Rehost = fastest, least cloud benefit
- Replatform = balanced approach
- Refactor = maximum benefit, most effort
- Repurchase = fastest value for commodity functions
- Retire = reduce scope and cost
- Retain = defer high-risk items
- Choose based on: timeline, budget, business value, risk tolerance

**Cloud vs. On-Premises:**
- Variable workloads → Cloud
- Unpredictable growth → Cloud
- Steady-state, predictable → Consider either (run TCO)
- Innovation needed → Cloud (access to AI/ML, analytics)
- Specific compliance → Verify (usually cloud works with proper controls)

#### 3. Know the Numbers (General Ranges)
You don't need exact prices, but understand general economics:
- Cloud TCO typically 20-40% lower than on-premises
- Committed use discounts: 30-57% vs. on-demand
- Preemptible/spot instances: 60-91% discounts
- Typical cloud uptime SLAs: 99.9% to 99.99%
- Migration payback periods: 12-36 months depending on approach
- Typical cost savings areas: 30-50% through optimization

#### 4. Common Exam Traps to Avoid

**Trap 1: Over-Engineering**
- Exam question: "Small startup needs to launch quickly with limited budget"
- Wrong: Multi-cloud architecture with custom infrastructure
- Right: Single cloud, managed services (PaaS/SaaS), focus on product

**Trap 2: Always Choosing Most Complex**
- More cloud providers ≠ better
- More control ≠ better
- Most technical solution ≠ best business solution
- Choose simplest solution that meets business requirements

**Trap 3: Ignoring Business Constraints**
- Questions include constraints for a reason (budget, timeline, skills, compliance)
- Technically perfect solution that ignores constraints is wrong answer
- Best answer addresses all stated constraints

**Trap 4: Forgetting Change Management**
- Technology change alone doesn't ensure success
- Training, culture, processes matter
- Gradual adoption often better than big bang
- Pilot projects to learn and build confidence

#### 5. Google Cloud Product Knowledge (High-Level)

**You need to know what products do, not how to configure them:**

**Compute:**
- Compute Engine = VMs (IaaS)
- App Engine = Managed application platform (PaaS)
- Cloud Functions = Serverless functions
- Cloud Run = Containerized applications (PaaS)
- GKE = Kubernetes (containers at scale)

**Storage:**
- Cloud Storage = Object storage (files, backups, archives)
- Persistent Disk = Block storage (VM disks)
- Filestore = File storage (NFS)

**Databases:**
- Cloud SQL = Managed relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Cloud Spanner = Global distributed database
- Firestore = NoSQL document database
- Bigtable = NoSQL wide-column database

**Data and Analytics:**
- BigQuery = Data warehouse and analytics
- Dataflow = Data processing pipelines
- Pub/Sub = Messaging and event streaming
- Looker = Business intelligence and visualization

**AI/ML:**
- Vertex AI = Machine learning platform
- Vision AI, Natural Language AI, Translation AI = Pre-built AI models

**Management:**
- Cloud Console = Web UI for managing resources
- Cloud IAM = Identity and access management
- Cloud Monitoring = Performance and uptime monitoring
- Cloud Billing = Cost management and billing

**Networking:**
- VPC = Virtual private cloud (isolated network)
- Cloud Load Balancing = Distribute traffic
- Cloud CDN = Content delivery network

**You only need to know:** What each does, when you'd use it, business benefits. Not pricing, configurations, or technical details.
