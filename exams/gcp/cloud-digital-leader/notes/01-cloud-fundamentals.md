# Cloud Fundamentals

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Google Cloud.

### Key Characteristics
