# Core Google Cloud Platform Services

> **Cloud Digital Leader Focus:** This section covers GCP services from a BUSINESS perspective - understanding WHAT services do, WHY to choose them, and WHEN to use them for business value. Focus on business outcomes, cost optimization, and strategic decision-making.

## Compute Services Overview

Compute services form the foundation of your cloud infrastructure. The key business question is: **How much operational responsibility do you want?**

**Business Decision Framework:**
- **Full control needed?** Choose Compute Engine (IaaS)
- **Focus on code, not infrastructure?** Choose App Engine (PaaS)
- **Containerized applications?** Choose GKE or Cloud Run
- **Event-driven, short tasks?** Choose Cloud Functions
- **Serverless containers?** Choose Cloud Run

## Compute Services

### Compute Engine (IaaS)
**What it is:** Virtual machines running in Google's data centers - maximum control and flexibility

**Business Value:**
- **Cost optimization:** Custom machine types prevent over-provisioning (only pay for exact resources needed)
- **Legacy migration:** Easiest path for "lift-and-shift" migrations from on-premises
- **No vendor lock-in:** Standard VMs work like any server environment
- **Business continuity:** Live migration means zero downtime during maintenance
- **Budget control:** Sustained use discounts (up to 30%) automatic, no upfront commitment

**Key Business Features:**
- **Custom machine types:** Tailor CPU and memory to your needs - optimize costs by avoiding oversized instances
- **Preemptible instances:** Up to 80% cost savings for fault-tolerant workloads (batch processing, rendering)
- **Live migration:** Zero-downtime maintenance - Google moves VMs between hosts transparently
- **Sustained use discounts:** Automatic discounts (up to 30%) for long-running instances - no commitment required
- **Committed use discounts:** 57% savings for 1-year, 70% for 3-year commitments
- **Global load balancing:** Distribute traffic across regions for performance and reliability

**When to Choose Compute Engine (Business Perspective):**
- Migrating existing applications with minimal changes (lift-and-shift strategy)
- Applications requiring specific OS configurations or licensed software
- Need full control over the operating system and environment
- Running workloads where you want to optimize every aspect of cost and performance
- Legacy applications that cannot be easily containerized or refactored

**Business Use Cases:**
- Web servers and application hosting for traditional architectures
- Development and testing environments that need various configurations
- High-performance computing (HPC) for research, financial modeling, rendering
- SAP, Oracle, and enterprise applications requiring specific configurations
- Disaster recovery infrastructure (cost-effective with preemptible instances)

**Cost Considerations:**
- Most flexible pricing with per-second billing (1-minute minimum)
- Sustained use discounts automatic - good for always-on workloads
- Preemptible VMs for 80% savings on non-critical workloads
- Custom machine types prevent waste from oversized instances
- Budget visibility: easy to track and forecast costs

**Pricing Model:** Pay per second with a 1-minute minimum; automatic discounts for sustained use

### App Engine (PaaS)
**What it is:** Platform for building and hosting web applications - focus on code, Google manages infrastructure

**Business Value:**
- **Faster time-to-market:** Developers focus on business logic, not infrastructure management
- **Automatic cost optimization:** Scale to zero when idle, no paying for unused capacity
- **Reduced operational overhead:** No need for DevOps team to manage servers, patching, scaling
- **Traffic management:** Built-in A/B testing and gradual rollouts reduce deployment risk
