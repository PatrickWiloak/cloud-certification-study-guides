- Trigger: Cloud Functions on object finalize
- Processing: Cloud Functions or Cloud Run
- Output: BigQuery or another bucket

### Scenario 3: Data Analytics Pipeline
**Requirements**: Ingest, process, analyze data
**Solution**:
- Ingestion: Pub/Sub
- Stream processing: Dataflow
- Storage: BigQuery
- Visualization: Looker or Data Studio
- Orchestration: Cloud Composer

### Scenario 4: Hybrid Cloud
**Requirements**: Connect on-premises to GCP securely
**Solution**:
- Connectivity: Cloud VPN (encrypted) or Cloud Interconnect (dedicated)
- VPC: Configure Cloud Router for BGP
- Private Google Access: Access Google APIs
- DNS: Cloud DNS for hybrid resolution

## gcloud Command Patterns

### Configuration
```bash
# Set project
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

# Set region/zone
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

# View configuration
gcloud config list
```

### Compute
```bash
# Create VM
gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME

# Create instance template
gcloud compute instance-templates create TEMPLATE_NAME

# Create managed instance group
gcloud compute instance-groups managed create GROUP_NAME \
  --template=TEMPLATE_NAME --size=3
```

### Storage
```bash
# Create bucket
gsutil mb gs://BUCKET_NAME

# Copy files
gsutil cp file.txt gs://BUCKET_NAME/
gsutil -m cp -r folder gs://BUCKET_NAME/

# Set lifecycle
gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://BUCKET_NAME/
```

### GKE
```bash
# Create cluster
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME

# Get credentials
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME

# Kubectl commands
kubectl get pods
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Best Practices by Domain

### Compute
1. Use preemptible VMs for fault-tolerant workloads
2. Enable auto-scaling for variable load
3. Use managed instance groups for HA
4. Implement health checks
5. Use appropriate machine types

### Storage
1. Choose appropriate storage class for access pattern
2. Enable versioning for important data
3. Implement lifecycle policies
4. Use signed URLs for temporary access
5. Enable uniform bucket-level access

### Networking
1. Use VPC for resource isolation
2. Implement firewall rules (least privilege)
3. Use Cloud NAT for private instances
4. Enable Private Google Access
5. Use Cloud CDN for global content

### Security
1. Follow principle of least privilege
2. Use service accounts for applications
3. Enable audit logging
4. Rotate keys regularly
5. Use Secret Manager for credentials
6. Enable Binary Authorization for GKE

### Cost Optimization
1. Use committed use discounts (1 or 3 years)
2. Right-size VMs based on usage
3. Use preemptible VMs (up to 80% savings)
4. Stop unused resources
5. Use lifecycle policies for storage
6. Monitor with budgets and alerts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not reading carefully**: Look for "EXCEPT" or "NOT"
2. **Ignoring constraints**: Cost, region, performance
3. **Choosing complex over simple**: Start simple
4. **Missing keywords**: "Least cost", "highest performance"
5. **Confusing services**: Cloud SQL vs Spanner, GKE vs Cloud Run

## Exam Day Strategy

### Before Exam
- Review key services and use cases
- Practice gcloud commands
- Take practice exams (aim for 75%+)
- Rest well

### During Exam
- Read each question carefully
- Identify key requirements
- Eliminate wrong answers
- Flag uncertain questions
