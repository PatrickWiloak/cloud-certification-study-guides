## Key Security Principles and Best Practices

### Defense in Depth

Implement multiple layers of security controls:

1. **Perimeter Security**: Firewall rules, Cloud Armor, VPC Service Controls
2. **Identity Security**: IAM, Cloud Identity, Context-Aware Access
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, DLP, access controls
4. **Application Security**: Binary Authorization, vulnerability scanning
5. **Monitoring**: Cloud Logging, Security Command Center, alerting

### Principle of Least Privilege

**[📖 Least Privilege IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#least_privilege)** - Granting minimal necessary permissions

**Best Practices:**
- Use predefined roles over basic roles
- Create custom roles for specific needs
- Grant roles at the lowest resource level possible
- Use service accounts for applications
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions
- Use IAM Recommender to identify over-privileged accounts
- Implement temporary elevated access with IAM conditions

### Separation of Duties

**[📖 Separation of Duties](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/separation-of-duties)** - Preventing conflicts of interest

**Implementation Strategies:**
- Different teams manage network, security, and applications
- Multiple approvers for critical changes
- No single person has full administrative access
- Use separate projects for development, staging, production
- Implement change approval workflows

### Zero Trust Security

**Zero Trust Principles:**
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach
- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Segment access
- Monitor and log everything

### Security by Default

- Default encryption at rest and in transit
- Disable unnecessary services and APIs
- Use secure defaults for configurations
- Enable audit logging by default
- Implement organization policies early

### Shared Responsibility Model

**[📖 Shared Responsibility](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/shared-responsibility-shared-fate)** - Understanding security ownership

**Google's Responsibilities:**
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Hypervisor and host OS

**Customer's Responsibilities:**
- IAM and access controls
- Data encryption keys (CMEK)
- Application security
- Network configuration
- Data classification and protection
- Compliance with regulations

## Exam Preparation Tips

### Key Topics to Master

1. **IAM Deep Dive**: Roles, policies, service accounts, conditions, best practices
2. **VPC Service Controls**: Perimeters, access levels, ingress/egress rules
3. **Cloud KMS**: CMEK, key rotation, HSM, envelope encryption
4. **Security Command Center**: All detection capabilities, findings, notifications
5. **Organization Policies**: Common constraints, inheritance model
6. **Network Security**: Firewall rules, Cloud Armor, load balancer security
7. **Data Protection**: DLP, encryption options, Secret Manager
8. **Compliance**: Major frameworks (HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR), Assured Workloads
9. **Container Security**: Binary Authorization, GKE hardening, Workload Identity
10. **Monitoring and Logging**: Audit logs, log exports, alerting

### Hands-On Practice

Set up free tier or trial account and practice:
- Creating IAM policies with conditions
- Configuring VPC Service Controls perimeters
- Setting up Cloud KMS keys and encryption
- Deploying Binary Authorization policies
- Configuring Cloud Armor rules
- Creating organization policies
- Analyzing Security Command Center findings
- Setting up DLP inspection jobs
- Implementing secure GKE clusters
- Configuring audit log sinks

### Common Exam Patterns

- Scenario-based questions requiring multiple services
- Identifying most secure solution among options
- Troubleshooting security misconfigurations
- Selecting appropriate encryption strategy
- Determining compliance requirements
- Optimizing security posture
- Incident response procedures

### Time Management

- 2 hours for 50-60 questions = ~2 minutes per question
- Read questions carefully for keywords
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Flag uncertain questions for review
- Don't spend more than 3-4 minutes on any question

### Study Resources

- Official Google Cloud documentation (most important)
- Google Cloud Skills Boost (formerly Qwiklabs)
- Sample questions from Google
- Coursera Security specialization
- YouTube Google Cloud Tech channel
- Practice exams
- Community study groups
