**[ðŸ“– Forseti Security](https://forsetisecurity.org/)** - Open-source security toolkit (now deprecated)

**Note:** Forseti Security has been deprecated in favor of Security Command Center and native Google Cloud security services. While it may still appear in legacy documentation, focus on Security Command Center for exam preparation.

**Forseti Components (Historical Knowledge):**
- Inventory: Asset discovery and snapshot
- Scanner: Policy violation detection
- Enforcer: Automatic remediation
- Explain: IAM policy analysis
- Notifier: Alert distribution

Modern alternatives:
- SCC Asset Discovery replaces Forseti Inventory

## Key Security Principles and Best Practices

### Defense in Depth

Implement multiple layers of security controls:

1. **Perimeter Security**: Firewall rules, Cloud Armor, VPC Service Controls
2. **Identity Security**: IAM, Cloud Identity, Context-Aware Access
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, DLP, access controls
4. **Application Security**: Binary Authorization, vulnerability scanning
5. **Monitoring**: Cloud Logging, Security Command Center, alerting

### Principle of Least Privilege

**[ðŸ“– Least Privilege IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/using-iam-securely#least_privilege)** - Granting minimal necessary permissions

**Best Practices:**
- Use predefined roles over basic roles
- Create custom roles for specific needs
- Grant roles at the lowest resource level possible
- Use service accounts for applications
- Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions
- Use IAM Recommender to identify over-privileged accounts
- Implement temporary elevated access with IAM conditions

### Separation of Duties

**[ðŸ“– Separation of Duties](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/separation-of-duties)** - Preventing conflicts of interest

**Implementation Strategies:**
- Different teams manage network, security, and applications
- Multiple approvers for critical changes
- No single person has full administrative access
- Use separate projects for development, staging, production
- Implement change approval workflows

### Zero Trust Security

**[ðŸ“– BeyondCorp Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise)** - Zero trust access platform

**[ðŸ“– Zero Trust Architecture](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/zero-trust-architecture)** - Implementation guide

**Zero Trust Principles:**
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach
- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Segment access
- Monitor and log everything

### Security by Default

- Default encryption at rest and in transit
- Disable unnecessary services and APIs
- Use secure defaults for configurations
- Enable audit logging by default
- Implement organization policies early

### Shared Responsibility Model

**[ðŸ“– Shared Responsibility](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/shared-responsibility-shared-fate)** - Understanding security ownership

**Google's Responsibilities:**
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Hypervisor and host OS

**Customer's Responsibilities:**
- IAM and access controls
- Data encryption keys (CMEK)
- Application security
- Network configuration
- Data classification and protection
- Compliance with regulations
