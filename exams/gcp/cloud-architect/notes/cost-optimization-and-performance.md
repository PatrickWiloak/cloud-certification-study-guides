**Committed Use Discounts**: 1-year or 3-year commitments, 57% discount for most resources
**Sustained Use Discounts**: Automatic discounts for consistent usage, up to 30% off
**Preemptible VMs**: Up to 80% discount, suitable for fault-tolerant workloads
**Spot VMs**: Latest preemptible offering, flexible pricing
**Resource Scheduling**: Shut down non-production during off-hours
**Auto-scaling**: Scale down during low-demand periods

### Storage Cost Optimization
**Storage Classes**: Standard → Nearline → Coldline → Archive based on access
**Lifecycle Policies**: Automate transitions and deletions
**Object Versioning**: Manage retention, delete old versions
**Compression**: Reduce storage size for archival data
**Regional vs Multi-Regional**: Choose based on access patterns
**Persistent Disk**: Standard for sequential, SSD for random I/O
**Snapshot Management**: Schedule deletion of old snapshots

### Network Cost Optimization
**Egress Traffic**: Minimize data transfer out of GCP
**Regional Resources**: Keep resources in same region
**Cloud CDN**: Cache at edge, reduce origin traffic
**Premium vs Standard Tier**: Standard for cost-sensitive, Premium for performance
**VPC Peering**: Avoid inter-region traffic
**Cloud NAT**: Shared NAT gateway for multiple instances
**Load Balancer Selection**: Match to use case

### Database Cost Optimization
**Right-sizing Instances**: Match resources to workload
**Read Replicas**: Use for read scaling, not HA if not needed
**Connection Pooling**: Reduce connection overhead
**Query Optimization**: Improve efficiency
**Storage Optimization**: Archive old data, compression
**BigQuery**: Partition tables, clustering, query optimization, flat-rate pricing for heavy users

## Performance Optimization

### Compute Performance
**Machine Type Selection**: Match CPU/memory to workload
**Local SSD**: Use for extreme IOPS requirements
**GPU/TPU**: For ML and compute-intensive workloads
**CPU Platforms**: Choose appropriate CPU generation
**Network Performance**: Use higher tier machines for network throughput
**NUMA**: Optimize for NUMA architecture on large VMs

### Storage Performance
**SSD vs Standard Disks**: SSD for IOPS, Standard for throughput
**Disk Size**: Larger disks = better performance
**IOPS Scaling**: Size disks appropriately for IOPS needs
**Local SSD**: Maximum performance, ephemeral
**Persistent Disk Performance**: Scale with size and VM cores
**Parallel Transfers**: Use gsutil -m for Cloud Storage

### Network Performance
**Premium Tier**: Lower latency, better performance
**Regional Resources**: Reduce cross-region latency
**CDN**: Cache at edge for global users
**Cloud Interconnect**: Dedicated bandwidth for hybrid
**VPC Design**: Minimize hops, optimize routes
**Load Balancer Selection**: Global for global users, internal for microservices

### Database Performance
**Indexing**: Optimize query performance
**Connection Pooling**: Reduce connection overhead
**Caching**: Memorystore for frequently accessed data
**Read Replicas**: Distribute read load
**Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning for scale
**BigQuery**: Partitioning, clustering, materialized views
**Cloud Spanner**: Global distribution, horizontal scaling

### Caching Strategies
**Application-Level**: In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached)
**CDN**: Cloud CDN for static content
**Database**: Query result caching
**API Gateway**: Response caching
**Multi-Layer**: Combine multiple caching layers
**Cache Invalidation**: Implement proper invalidation strategy

## Capacity Planning

### Resource Forecasting
**Historical Analysis**: Analyze past usage patterns
**Growth Projections**: Plan for anticipated growth
**Seasonal Variations**: Account for traffic patterns
**Buffer Capacity**: Maintain headroom for spikes
**Scaling Limits**: Understand service quotas
**Load Testing**: Validate capacity assumptions

### Scalability Design
**Horizontal Scaling**: Design for scale-out
**Stateless Services**: Separate state from compute
**Auto-scaling Configuration**: Based on appropriate metrics
**Database Scaling**: Read replicas, sharding, caching
**Queue-Based Load Leveling**: Use Pub/Sub for spikes
**Async Processing**: Offload non-critical work

## Cost Management

### Cost Visibility
**Billing Reports**: Analyze spending patterns
**Cost Breakdown**: By project, service, label
**Budget Alerts**: Threshold-based notifications
**BigQuery Export**: Detailed cost analysis
**Resource Labels**: Tag for cost allocation
**Committed Use Analysis**: Track utilization
**Recommendations**: Use Google's cost recommendations

### Cost Control Mechanisms
**Quotas**: Prevent runaway costs
**Organization Policies**: Enforce constraints
**Budget Alerts**: Proactive notifications
**Resource Scheduling**: Automated start/stop
**Approval Workflows**: For expensive resources
**Regular Reviews**: Weekly/monthly cost analysis
**Showback/Chargeback**: Department-level accountability
