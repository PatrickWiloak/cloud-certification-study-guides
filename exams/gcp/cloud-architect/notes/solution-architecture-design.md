## Design Principles

### Scalability Design Principles
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for scale-out rather than scale-up
2. **Stateless Components**: Separate state from compute
3. **Caching Layers**: Implement multi-level caching
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use queues for non-real-time work
5. **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases
6. **Auto-scaling**: Use managed auto-scaling services
7. **Load Distribution**: Implement effective load balancing

### Reliability Design Principles
1. **Redundancy**: Eliminate single points of failure
2. **Health Checks**: Implement comprehensive health monitoring
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Design for partial functionality during failures
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
5. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
6. **Chaos Engineering**: Test system resilience proactively
7. **Regional Distribution**: Deploy across multiple regions

### Security Design Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions
3. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
4. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data at rest and in transit
5. **Security by Design**: Build security into architecture
6. **Segregation of Duties**: Separate critical roles
7. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Cost Optimization Principles
1. **Right-Sizing**: Match resources to actual needs
2. **Committed Use**: Purchase commitments for predictable workloads
3. **Spot/Preemptible**: Use for fault-tolerant workloads
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Archive or delete unused data
5. **Serverless First**: Leverage serverless for variable workloads
6. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Track costs continuously
7. **Resource Scheduling**: Shut down non-production during off-hours

## Best Practices

### Architecture Documentation Best Practices
1. **Architecture Diagrams**: Use standard notation (C4, UML)
2. **Decision Records**: Document key architectural decisions
3. **Component Descriptions**: Detail each component's purpose
4. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Show data movement through system
5. **Security Architecture**: Document security controls
6. **Deployment Architecture**: Show deployment topology
7. **Cost Estimates**: Include TCO calculations
8. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Document performance, security, etc.

### Requirement Gathering Best Practices
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Understand business needs
2. **Current State Analysis**: Document existing architecture
3. **Constraint Identification**: Identify technical and business constraints
4. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria
5. **Prioritization**: Rank requirements by importance
6. **Trade-off Analysis**: Document design trade-offs
7. **Assumption Documentation**: Record all assumptions

### Migration Planning Best Practices
1. **Assessment Phase**: Comprehensive inventory and analysis
2. **Migration Strategy**: Choose appropriate strategy per workload
3. **Pilot Projects**: Start with low-risk applications
4. **Phased Approach**: Migrate in manageable phases
