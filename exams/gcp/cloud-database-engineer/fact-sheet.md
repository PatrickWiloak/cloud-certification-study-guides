## Database Design Patterns

### Relational Database Patterns

**Normalization vs Denormalization:**
- Normalize for OLTP (transaction processing)
- Denormalize for OLAP (analytical queries)
- Consider read/write patterns
- Balance storage vs query performance

**Partitioning Strategies:**
- Horizontal partitioning (sharding)
- Vertical partitioning (column splitting)
- Range-based partitioning
- Hash-based partitioning

### NoSQL Design Patterns

**Document Database Patterns (Firestore):**
- Embed vs reference
- Denormalize for read performance
- Collection group queries
- Hierarchical data with subcollections

**Wide-Column Patterns (Bigtable):**
- Row key as index
- Column families for data grouping
- Time-series with reverse timestamps
- Avoid hotspots with key distribution

### Caching Patterns

**Cache-Aside:**
- Application checks cache first
- On miss, load from database and populate cache
- Suitable for read-heavy workloads

**Write-Through:**
- Write to cache and database simultaneously
- Ensures cache consistency
- Higher write latency

**Write-Behind:**
- Write to cache immediately
- Asynchronous write to database
- Better write performance, risk of data loss

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

### Backup Strategies

**Backup Types:**
- Full backups
- Incremental backups
- Differential backups
- Point-in-time recovery

**Backup Retention:**
- Compliance requirements
- Cost vs recovery needs
- Lifecycle policies for long-term retention

### High Availability Architecture

**Multi-Zone Deployment:**
- Cloud SQL HA configuration
- Automatic failover
- Regional persistent disks
- RTO: 60-120 seconds
- RPO: Zero (synchronous replication)

**Multi-Region Deployment:**
- Cloud Spanner multi-region
- Cross-region read replicas
- AlloyDB cross-region replication
- Lower RPO/RTO for global applications

### Disaster Recovery Testing

**DR Drills:**
- Regular failover testing
- Backup restoration validation
- RTO/RPO measurement
- Documentation and runbooks
- Post-mortem analysis

## Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

**Indexing Strategies:**
- Index frequently queried columns
- Composite indexes for multiple columns
- Covering indexes to avoid table lookups
- Avoid over-indexing (impacts writes)

**Query Analysis:**
- Explain plans for query optimization
- Identify slow queries
- Optimize JOIN operations
- Reduce data scanned

### Connection Management

**Connection Pooling:**
- Reduce connection overhead
- Reuse database connections
- Configure appropriate pool size
- Handle connection failures gracefully

**Connection Limits:**
- Cloud SQL: Based on machine type
- Spanner: 10,000 sessions default (configurable)
- Monitor active connections
- Use Cloud SQL Proxy for connection management

### Storage Optimization

**Data Archival:**
- Move cold data to cheaper storage tiers
- Cloud Storage for historical data
- BigQuery for analytics on archived data
- Lifecycle policies for automation

**Compression:**
- Enable compression for backups
- Compressed table formats
- Reduce storage costs and improve I/O

## Exam Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: High-Volume Transactional System

**Requirements:** Global e-commerce, strong consistency, 100k+ TPS, 99.999% availability

**Solution:**
- Cloud Spanner multi-region configuration
- Schema design avoiding hotspots
- Read-only transactions for queries
- Connection pooling at application layer
- Autoscaling for traffic bursts

**Key Decision:** Spanner for global scale with strong consistency, despite higher cost

### Scenario 2: Time-Series IoT Data

**Requirements:** Billions of events per day, sub-10ms read latency, retention 7 years

**Solution:**
- Bigtable for writes and recent data queries
- Row key with reverse timestamp
- HDD nodes for cost optimization
- Backup to Cloud Storage for archival
- Dataflow for bulk loading

**Key Decision:** Bigtable for massive scale and low latency; archive old data to reduce costs

### Scenario 3: MySQL Migration with Minimal Downtime

**Requirements:** 2 TB MySQL database, < 1 hour downtime, validate before cutover

**Solution:**
- Database Migration Service for continuous replication
- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL as target (or MySQL)
- VPC peering for private connectivity
- Parallel testing on replica
- Planned cutover during low-traffic period

**Key Decision:** DMS for minimal downtime; test thoroughly before cutover

### Scenario 4: Multi-Region Read Scaling

**Requirements:** Global user base, read-heavy workload, < 100ms latency worldwide

**Solution:**
- Cloud SQL with cross-region read replicas
- OR Cloud Spanner multi-region for writes
- Cloud CDN for cacheable content
- Regional routing with Load Balancer
- Connection pooling per region

**Key Decision:** Cloud SQL read replicas if writes are regional; Spanner if global writes needed

### Scenario 5: Real-Time Analytics on Operational Data

**Requirements:** PostgreSQL transactional database, real-time analytics without impacting OLTP

**Solution:**
- AlloyDB for PostgreSQL
- Columnar engine for analytical queries
- Read pool for analytics separation
- OR: Cloud SQL with read replicas, export to BigQuery
- Dataflow for streaming CDC to BigQuery

**Key Decision:** AlloyDB columnar engine for integrated HTAP; BigQuery for separate analytics

### Scenario 6: Compliance and Data Residency

**Requirements:** HIPAA compliance, data must stay in us-central1, audit all access

**Solution:**
- Cloud SQL or Spanner in us-central1
- CMEK with Cloud KMS
- Private IP only (no public exposure)
- VPC Service Controls for perimeter
- Cloud Audit Logs for all data access
- IAM with least privilege

**Key Decision:** Regional instance configuration with encryption, auditing, and network isolation
