```
Week 1-2:   Watch video courses, read documentation
Week 3-4:   Hands-on labs and practice
Week 5-6:   Practice exams and review weak areas
Week 7:     Final review and exam
```

**Best For:** Career transition, unemployed, dedicated study time

#### Moderate Schedule (Part-Time Study)
**Commitment:** 2-3 hours per day, 5-6 days per week

```
Week 1-4:   Theory learning (videos, documentation)
Week 5-8:   Hands-on practice and labs
Week 9-10:  Practice exams and weak area review
Week 11-12: Final review and exam
```

### Multi-Certification Timeline Planning

#### Example: AWS Associate Track (All 3 Certifications)

**Sequential Approach** (One at a time)
```
Months 1-3:  Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)
Months 4-6:  Developer Associate (DVA-C02)
Months 7-9:  SysOps Administrator (SOA-C02)

Total: 9 months
```

**Parallel Approach** (Overlap studies)
```
Months 1-2:  SAA-C03 primary focus
Month 3:     SAA-C03 final prep + DVA-C02 start
Months 4-5:  DVA-C02 primary focus
Month 6:     DVA-C02 final prep + SOA-C02 start
Months 7-8:  SOA-C02 primary focus
